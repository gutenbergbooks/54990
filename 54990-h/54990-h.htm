<p class="indent">The night had fallen and the Caf&eacute; Belle
Vue was crowded with soldiers in khaki.
The day&#39;s work was at an end, and the
men had left their billets to come out and spend
a few hours in the wine-shop of Jean Lacroix. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
whole division was quartered in the district; it
had come back from the firing-line and was enjoying
a brief period of rest prior to its departure
for the trenches again.</p>

<p class="indent">Even here, back near the town of Cassel, the
men were not free from the sights and sounds of
the fighting. At night they could see the red
agony of war painting the distant horizon, and
hear the far-off rumbling of the big guns as the
thunder and tumult of the conflict smote across
the world. The men back from the line of
slaughter tried not to think too clearly of what
was happening out there. In the Caf&eacute; Belle
Vue, where the wine was good, men could forget
things.</p>

<p class="indent">The Caf&eacute; was crowded. Half-a-dozen soldiers
stood at the bar and the patronne served out
drinks with a speedy hand. Behind her was a
number of shelves on which stood bottles of various
sizes. Over the shelves were two photographs;
one was her own, the other was that of
her husband when he was a thinner man and a
soldier in the army. In the house there was one
child, a dirty, ragged little girl, who sat in a
corner and fixed a dull meaningless stare on the
soldiers as they entered the caf&eacute;.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Lacroix sat beside the long-necked stove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
stroking his beard, a neat white little beard which
stood perkily out from his fat chin. Jean Lacroix
was fat, a jelly blob of a man with flesh
hanging from his sides, from his cheeks and
from his hands. He was a heap of blubber
wrapped in cloth. When he changed his locality
he shuffled instead of walking, when he laughed
he shivered and shook his fat as if he wanted to
fling it off. He was seldom serious, when he
was, all those near him laughed. A serious Jean
was a ridiculous figure.</p>

<p class="indent">His wife was an aggressive female with a dark
moustache, the tongue of a shrew and the eye of
a money-lender. She worked like an ant and
seldom spoke to her husband. Jean, wise with
the wisdom of a well-fed man, rarely said a word
to her; he sat by the fire all day and spoke to
anyone else who cared to listen.</p>

<p class="indent">A sergeant and three men entered and going
up to the bar called for drinks. These soldiers
were billeted at Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm which stood some
three kilometres away from the Caf&eacute; Belle Vue.
They belonged to the London Irish Regiment.
The battalion had just come down from Hulluch
for a rest. Having procured their drinks the
four men sat down, lit their cigarettes and entered
into a noisy conversation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Before going any further it will be well to say
a few words about these men, the principal personages
of my story.</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant&#39;s name was Snogger. He was
a well-built man, straight as a ramrod and supple
as an eel. He was very strict on parade, a model
soldier, a terror to recruits and a rank disciplinarian.
&quot;When you&#39;re on parade you&#39;re on parade,&quot;
was his pet saying. He had a tendency
to use the letter &quot;w&quot; a little too often when
speaking. Once he said admonishing a dilatory
squad: &quot;You blokes in the wear wank must
wipe your wifles wiv woily wags in future!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger was a handsome man, proud
as Lucifer and very careful about his person.
His moustache was always waxed, his finger nails
were always clean, and whenever possible he
slept with his trousers placed under his bed and
neatly folded. Thus a most artistic crease was
obtained.</p>

<p class="indent">Snogger had peculiar ears. Their tops pressed
very closely into the head and the lobes stood
out. Looking at the ears from the side they had
an appearance similar to that of a shovel
stretched out to catch something; seen from behind
they looked as if crouching against a parapet
waiting for an oncoming shell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
The men liked Snogger and the sergeant preferred
the company of riflemen to that of his
brother N.C.O.&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy Benners was a different type of man.
A young fellow of twenty-four, slightly over
medium height, but thick-set and sturdy. He
had remarkably long arms, heavy buttocks and
broad shoulders. The latter he swung vigorously
when marching. This motion imparted a certain
defiant swagger to the man which his placid
nature utterly belied. He was of a kindly disposition,
extremely good-humoured, but very
self-conscious and blushed red as a poppy when
spoken to. There was something very amiable
and kind in his face; something good and comforting
in his sleepy eyes, his rather thick lips
and full cheeks. His ears perhaps were out of
keeping with the repose which found expression
on the rest of his features. They stood out from
his head alert and ready, as it seemed, to jump
from their perch on to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy could drink like a fish, but French beer
never made him drunk and champagne merely
made him merry. When merry he swore and his
companions laughed at this unaccustomed violence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Devil blow me blind,&quot; he would say, stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
his long arm across the table at which he
might be sitting and bringing down his massive
fist with a thundering bang. &quot;Devil blow me
stone blind for a fool!&quot; And all the soldiers
around would laugh and wink at one another, as
much as to say: &quot;Is he not a big silly fool; not
half as clever as we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy was not indeed particularly clever; he
lacked excessive sharpness of wit. But his
mates loved him, for his spirit of comradeship
was very genuine and he had a generous sympathy
for all things good and noble. Often when
the boys&#39; tongues were loosened in a French
tavern one of them might be heard saying: &quot;Old
Bowdy&#39;s a damned good sort. I&#39;d follow him
anywhere, even to hell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the others would answer: &quot;None like
old Bowdy. One of the best he is. And a good
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy was indeed a good man; a great fighter.
In raids, in bayonet charges and bombing encounters
he was a force to be reckoned with and
never had an adversary been known to get the
better of him. Persistence, staying power and
dogged courage were his great assets, and these
when taken in conjunction with his good humour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
and simple nature made him a loved comrade
and worthy friend.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy was now seated at the inn table, drinking
beer with his mate, an alert youth with a snub
nose and bright vivacious eyes. His name was
Spudhole.</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole was a Londoner, a native of Walworth.
His real name was Thomas Bubb, but
his mates nicknamed him Spudhole, a slang
term for the guard-room. The nickname became
him, he liked it and was not a little proud of the
fact that no man in the regiment spent as many
days in the guard-room as did Rifleman Thomas
Bubb. He was eternally guilty of trivial offences
against Army regulations. This was in a great
measure due to his inability to accommodate
himself to a changed environment. He was a
coster unchangeable and unchanged; to him an
officer was always &quot;Guv&#39;nor,&quot; he addressed an
officer as such, and the Colonel was the &quot;ole
bloke.&quot; His tongue was seldom quiet and the
cries of his trade were ever on his tongue, even
on parade he often gave them expression. He
sang well, drank well, fought well, and loved
practical jokes.</p>

<p class="indent">Once at St. Albans he dressed himself up as
a corporal, took two of his mates to the railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
station and relieved the military police on duty
there. Mistaking him for a real N.C.O. they
left the station in his hands. Of course he took
the first train to London. On his return he was
awarded fourteen days&#39; spud-hole.</p>

<p class="indent">When in the guard-room he decided to escape
and at the hour of twelve on the first night when
a sentry stood on watch outside his prison Spudhole
broke the window with a resounding thump.
Then he rushed back and stood behind the door.
He was in stocking-soles, his boots were slung
round his shoulders by the laces. On hearing
the crash the sentry opened the door, sprang into
the room and hurried to the window thinking
that Spudhole was trying to escape by that quarter&mdash;and
Spudhole went out by the door.</p>

<p class="indent">He was very good-natured, in fact quixotic.
Once a recruit belonging to Bubb&#39;s section was
so very slack that the officer brought him out in
front of the squad and got him to perform several
movements in musketry drill. The remainder
of the party had to shout out when the man
made any mistakes. As is usual, the onlookers
saw many faults and shouted themselves hoarse.
But Bubb was silent. When the slack recruit
returned to his place in the ranks the officer spoke
to Spudhole.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;Did you notice any of those mistakes?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Bubb replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why did you not say so?&quot; enquired the
officer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t want to give the bloke away,&quot;
was Bubb&#39;s answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The youngster had spent four years in a reformatory;
afterwards as a coster he presided
over a barrow in a turning off Walworth Road.
His pitch was one of the best in the locality. He
fell in love with a girl who kept a barrow beside
him. He often spoke of her to Bowdy
Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s not &#39;arf a bird,&quot; he would say. &quot;Nobody
can take a mike out &#39;er. I&#39;m goin&#39; to get
spliced after the war too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Near the stove sat the remaining soldier, an
Irishman named Fitzgerald. He was a thin
graceful fellow of about five-and-twenty, and
could not, to judge by his appearance, boast of
very good health. His lips full and red, his
straight nose, delicate nostrils, black liquid eyes
and long lashes betrayed a passionate and sensitive
nature. He was a thoughtful man, grave
and dutiful, but at times as petulant and perverse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
as a child. Even when most perverse he
was good company.</p>

<p class="indent">He was exceedingly superstitious. His
thoughts generally wandered with startling suddenness
from one subject to another but this was
probably due to the use of strong drink. He had
had a college education but took to drink early
and squandered all his resources. Then he became
a rover and wandered through many parts
of the world as sailor, tramp and outcast. He
had slept in doss-houses, on the pavements, in
the fields. Once indeed he was a trombone
player in the Salvation Army, and again he
fought in a Mexican rebellion. Then he belonged
to a regiment, the soldiers of which had
to wear great coats on their triumphal march
through a certain town because of the bad condition
of their trousers. Fitz knew a smattering
of most languages but vowed that he was only
proficient in one&mdash;bad language.</p>

<p class="indent">At present he was in a gay good humour and
as he spoke to young Benners his voice, loud
enough but very soft and pleasant, penetrated
to the very corners of the inn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you ever feel afraid, Bowdy?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Funky, you know.&quot; Then, without waiting for
an answer, he went on: &quot;God! I do feel afraid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
sometimes. Out on listening patrol. It&#39;s hell
for a man with imagination. Crawling out in
the darkness between the lines. You hear the
grass whispering, and the darkness ahead of you
may hide anything. An awful face covered with
blood may rise up in front, a hand may come out
and grasp you by the hair. The dead are lying
around you, poor quiet creatures, but you know
that they&#39;re stronger than you are. I often wish
I couldn&#39;t think, that I lacked imagination, that
I was a clod of earth, just something like that
plebeian there.&quot; Fitzgerald raised his finger and
pointed to Bubb who was rapping his idle fingers
on the legs of his chair. Bubb gazed at Fitzgerald
and laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fleebian,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I know wot that
is. We &#39;ad one but the wheel came off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No imagination there,&quot; said Fitzgerald with
an air of finality. &quot;He couldn&#39;t be afraid, that
creature. No soul. I dare ten thousand times
as much to overcome my fear as that man would
dare to win the V.C. When I go out on listening
patrol I am always furthest out. I feel if I&#39;m
a yard behind the front man he&#39;ll consider me a
coward, so I get out a yard ahead of him and
I tremble all the time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God! I had a bad dream last night,&quot; Fitzgerald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
remarked swinging from one topic to another.
&quot;I dreamt I saw a woman dressed in
black looking into an empty grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a bad sign,&quot; said the sergeant.
&quot;You&#39;ll be damned unlucky the next time yer
go up to the trenches. Ye&#39;ll never come back.
Ye&#39;ll get done in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll come back safe and sound,&quot; Fitzgerald
replied in all seriousness. &quot;The dream
was a bad one and portended some evil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is it not bad enough to get done in?&quot;
asked Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are things worse than death,&quot; was
Fitzgerald&#39;s answer. &quot;Death is not the supreme
evil. But women! It&#39;s not good to dream of
them especially if they&#39;re red-haired. Did you
ever dream of red-haired women, Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy laughed but did not speak. Women
apparently did not attract him much and in their
company he was shy and diffident. Wanting to
get away as quickly as possible from their presence
he would rake up some imaginary appointment
from the back of his head, ask to be excused
and disappear. Behaviour of this kind though
natural to Bowdy Benners was quite inexplicable
to his mates. Fitzgerald having had a drop of
wine was now in a mood to discuss womanhood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;You&#39;re too damned modest, Bowdy,&quot; he said.
&quot;And you don&#39;t shine in the company of the
fair, dear women. You know the natural mission
of woman is to please man, and man, no matter
what he feels, should try and look pleased
when in her company. If he looks bored what
does that signify, Bowdy Benners? Eh? It
means that he has found her ugly. That&#39;s an insult
to the sex, to feminine charms and womanly
qualities. For myself I&#39;d much sooner sin and
please a woman than pose as a saint and annoy
her. Women don&#39;t like saints; what they want
most in life is Love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love! Love is the only allurement in existence,&quot;
said Fitzgerald rising to his feet. &quot;It is
the essence of life. Love, free and unrestrained,
not tied to the pillars of propriety by the manacles
of marriage. (That&#39;s a damned smart
phrase, isn&#39;t it, Spudhole?) Love is sacred, marriage
is not, marriage is governed by laws, love
is not. Nature has given us love. It is an instinct
and we shouldn&#39;t fight against it too much.
Why should we fight against a gift from God?
Some sacrilegious fool tried to improve on God&#39;s
handiwork and made laws to govern love. It&#39;s
like man to poke his nose in where it&#39;s not wanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
He&#39;d give the Lord soda water at the Last Supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Snoggers laughed boisterously, Bubb chuckled
and a lazy smile spread over Bowdy&#39;s face. The
gestures of the excited Irishman amused them.
He sat down, took a deep breath, then went on
to speak in a calmer voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love sweetens life,&quot; he said. &quot;It is like
sugar in children&#39;s physic. Here, Spudhole, were
you ever in love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, not arf,&quot; Spudhole answered and
winked. &quot;I&#39;m not arf a beggar wiv the birds.
I&#39;m....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That wench down at the farm, that girl Fifi
is a nice snug parcel o&#39; love,&quot; Snoggers interrupted,
&quot;I &#39;aven&#39;t arf got my &#39;and in down that
quarter. Wot d&#39;ye fink o&#39; &#39;er, Fitz?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot; asked Fitzgerald. He had become
suddenly alert.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ear &#39;im,&quot; said Bubb, winking at the Sergeant.
&quot;Old Fitz ain&#39;t arf a dodger; one o&#39; the
nuts that&#39;s wot &#39;e is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifi, the girl at the farm,&quot; said Snogger in
answer to Fitzgerald&#39;s question. &quot;Yer don&#39;t say
much when you&#39;re down there and &#39;er in the room
but your eyes are never off &#39;er.... I wouldn&#39;t
say nothin&#39; against rollin&#39; &#39;er in the straw....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
This mornin&#39; ... a funny thing ... she came
up to me and told me to put my &#39;and in &#39;ers. I
obliged &#39;er. Then she said to me: &#39;Two sous
for your thoughts.&#39; I didn&#39;t tell &#39;er wot I was
finkin&#39; of, but I didn&#39;t arf fink.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Snogger laughed loudly; Fitzgerald was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bet yer, yer wos finkin&#39; somefing wot wasn&#39;t
good, sarg,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye; and old Fitz is gwine dotty on the
wench,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;I see it in his
eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Botheration,&quot; Fitzgerald remarked. &quot;I know
the girl by sight and I know she makes good caf&eacute;-au-lait,
but I didn&#39;t even know her name until
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sing a song, Fitz,&quot; Bubb called out. &quot;A good
rousin&#39; song wiv &#39;air on&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I pay no heed to that creation, his tap-room
wit and yokel humour,&quot; muttered Fitzgerald,
turning to Benners. &quot;But if you desire it....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give us a bit o&#39; a song, Fitz,&quot; Benners replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me a cigarette and I&#39;ll sing you a song
that I love very much,&quot; Fitzgerald said. &quot;It was
sung in Ireland by the old women in the famine
times when they were dying of starvation. You
must picture the famine-stricken leaning over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
their turf fires and singing their songs of desolation.
(God! I think it was the turf-fires that
kept the race alive.)&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A strange glow overspread Fitzgerald&#39;s
face and he rose from his seat by the
stove and sat down again on a bench in
a corner and spread out his hands timorously
towards an imaginary fire. He bent his head
forward until it drooped almost to his knees and
his whole attitude took on a semblance of want
and woe beset with an overpowering fear. Benners
gasped involuntarily as he waited for the
song.</p>

<p class="indent">A long, drawn out, hardly audible note that
wavered like a thread of smoke quivered out into
the evil atmosphere of the apartment, it was followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
by a second and a third. A strange effect
was produced on all the listeners by the trembling
voice of the singer. Bubb gaped stupidly,
his eyes fixed on the roof, as he rubbed his chin
with the fingers of his right hand. The sergeant
drew himself up and listened, fascinated.
Fitzgerald&#39;s song was the song of a soul condemned
to inevitable sorrow; there was not a
relieving touch, not a glow of hope, it was the
song of a damned soul.</p>

&quot;My God, I&#39;ve forgotten it, Benners, forgotten
the rest of the song,&quot; Fitzgerald exclaimed,
throwing his unlighted cigarette on the floor and
gripping his hair with both hands as if going to
pull it out of his head. Then, as if thinking better
of it, he brought both his hands to his sides
and sat down on his original seat, his whole face
betokening extreme self-pity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My memory!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;My memory!
Why was I brought into being?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A minute&#39;s silence followed, then an eager
glow lit up Fitzgerald&#39;s face. A happy inspiration
seemed to have seized hold of him. &quot;Benners!&quot;
he exclaimed in an eager voice. &quot;Have
you a cigarette to spare, Benners?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gorblimey!&quot; laughed Bubb. &quot;Listen to &#39;im.
&#39;E&#39;s always on the &#39;ear-&#39;ole for fags, an&#39; &#39;e throws
arf of &#39;em away. &#39;E&#39;s not arf a nib, ole Fitz.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens, how can I endure such remarks
from a damned Sassenach! (I beg your
pardon, Bubb)&quot; Fitzgerald exclaimed, gripping
with both fingers the cigarette which Benners
had given him and breaking it in two. &quot;You
don&#39;t understand me, Bubb, you can&#39;t. I don&#39;t
bear you any malice, but, heavens! you are trying
at times.... By the way,&quot; he added, &quot;can
you give us one of your songs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Bubb looked at Fitzgerald for a moment then
lit a cigarette and got to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot about Ole Skiboo?&quot; he asked, addressing
the remark to all in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">The soldiers knew that he was going to oblige
and applauded with their hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb fixed his eyes on the patronne and
started:</p>

<p class="indent">The song, an old one probably, but adapted
to suit modern circumstances, was lustily chorused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
by the soldiers in the room. Bubb having
finished sat down, but presently rose to his feet
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oo&#39;l whistle the chorus of &#39;It&#39;s a long way
to Tipperary&#39;?&quot; he asked. &quot;Everybody do it together
and the one that does it froo I&#39;ll stand
&#39;im a drink. Nobody to laugh. And the one
that&#39;s not able to do it will stand me a drink. Is
that a bargain? Nobody to laugh, mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men agreed to Bubb&#39;s terms and started
whistling. But they did not get far. They had
drunk quite a lot and Bubb&#39;s final injunction
tickled them. One smiled, then another. Bowdy
Benners lay back and roared with laughter. He
tried to form his lips round a note but the effort
was futile. It was impossible to laugh and
whistle at the same time. Fitzgerald was making
a sound that reminded the listeners of an angry
cat spitting. His cheeks were puffed out and
his nose was sinking out of sight. The landlord
rolled from side to side choking almost, even the
patronne was smiling. The little ragged girl
came across the floor and stood in front of Fitz,
her hands behind her back. For a moment she
stood thus, then she ran away giggling and hid
behind the counter. Fitzgerald got to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bubb, Spudhole or whatever the devil they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
call you, you&#39;ve won,&quot; he said. &quot;What a queer
creature that child is, boys,&quot; he muttered, looking
at the youngster which was peeping slyly out
from behind the counter. &quot;Is it a boy or a girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb approached the counter and drank the
glass of vin rouge which Benners had paid for;
then he thrust his hands in his trouser pockets
and began to sing &quot;Sam Hall.&quot;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;My name is Samuel Hall,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Tiddy fol lol, tiddy fol lol!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bowdlerise it, you fool,&quot; Fitzgerald exclaimed
sitting down again. &quot;Bowdlerise the
song or stop singing. Bad taste, Bubb, bad taste.
Drink doesn&#39;t improve your morals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb ceased singing, not on Fitzgerald&#39;s behest,
but because the sergeant was standing him
a drink. Old Jean Lacroix who was slowly recovering
from his fit of laughter turned to Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Bosche broke through up by Souchez
last night,&quot; he said, pointing a fat thumb towards
the locality of the firing line. &quot;He broke through
in hundreds. He is unable to get back now and
he is roving all over the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They haven&#39;t been captured?&quot; said Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
&quot;Some of them,&quot; said Jean. &quot;Most of them
perhaps, but not all. Last night they were about
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here?&quot; enquired Fitzgerald. &quot;Did you see
them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I seen them?&quot; asked Jean, shivering
with laughter. &quot;They can&#39;t be seen. They disguise
themselves as turnips, as bushes, as English
soldiers.... Last night two of your countrymen,
soldiers, left here at nine o&#39;clock; and
got killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where were they killed?&quot; asked Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are billeted at Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm, are you
not?&quot; enquired the innkeeper. &quot;You are. Then
you came along the road to-night coming here.
Did you see a ruined cottage on your right, a
little distance back from the road?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mile from here?&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;Yes,
we saw it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is where it happened,&quot; said Jean Lacroix.
&quot;The two soldiers were found there this
morning with their throats cut, lying on the
floor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald got to his feet and entered an outer
room. There he found a copy of an English
magazine lying on a chair. He picked it up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
presently was deep in an article which tried to
prove that war would be a thing of the past if
Prussia ceased to exist. When he had finished
reading he came back to the man by the stove
and found him sitting there all alone, his eyes
fixed on the flames. Benners was not there, he
had left, accompanied by Spudhole and the sergeant.
The farm in which their company was
billeted was some two miles off.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald looked at his watch and saw that it
was nine o&#39;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nine o&#39;clock,&quot; he said aloud, and something
familiar in the words struck him. Two soldiers
left the wine shop the night previous at nine
o&#39;clock and next morning they were discovered
lying in a ruined cottage with their throats cut.
None of the men now in the inn were billeted at
Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm. Fitzgerald had to go home alone.
He swung his bandolier over his shoulder, lifted
his rifle from the table and went out into the
night. The story which Jean Lacroix had told
affected Fitzgerald strongly. A stranger in a
new locality he was ready to give credence to
any tale.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald had seen very little of trench warfare.
True, he had come out to France with his
regiment in March of 1915 but then he got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
wounded on his first journey to the trenches and
was sent back to England. He came out again
in time to take part in the battle of Loos and got
gassed in the charge. Followed a few weeks in
the hospital at Versailles and then he was sent
back to the trenches. He had seen a fortnight&#39;s
trench warfare, done turns in listening patrol and
sentry-go, before coming back with his battalion
to Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm near the town of Cassel. So
now, although first battalion man, he was in
many ways a &quot;rooky,&quot; one who was not as yet
versed in the practices of modern warfare. Now,
on the way back to his billet he thought of Jean
Lacroix&#39;s story and a strange fit of nervousness
laid hold of him. What might happen in the
darkness he could not tell, and he wished that his
mates had not gone leaving him to come back
alone. They ought to have looked him up. He
was annoyed with them. He was angry.</p>

<p class="indent">The road stretched out in front a dull streak
of grey, lined with ghostly poplars, that lost itself
in the darkness ahead. The night was
gloomy and chilly, a low weird wind crooned in
the grass and a belated night-bird shrieked painfully
in the sky above. Far out in front the carnage
was in full swing, the red fury of war lit
the line of battle and darts of flame, ghastly red,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
pierced the clouds in a hasty succession of short
vicious stabs. Round Fitzgerald was the flat
dead country, black and limitless, and over it
from time to time swift flashes of light would
rise and tremble in the gloom like will-o&#39;-the-wisps
over a churchyard. The sharp penetrating
odour of dung was in the air, the night-breath
of the low-lying land of Flanders.</p>

<p class="indent">The shadows gathered round the man silently.
One rushed in from the fields and took on an almost
definite form on the roadway in front. He
could not help gazing round from time to time
and staring back along the road. What might
be following! He was all alone, apart from his
kind, isolated. One hand gripped tightly on his
rifle and the fingers of the other fumbled at his
bandolier. He ran his hand over the cartridges,
counting them aloud. Fifty rounds. But he had
none in the magazine of his rifle. He should
have five there. But he would not put them in
now. He would make too much noise.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked at a good steady pace; and hummed
a tune under his breath, trying thus to keep down
any disposition to shiver. His eyes becoming
accustomed to the darkness could now take stock
of the roadway, the grassy verge and the ditch
on either side. The poplars rose high and became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
one with the sombre darkness of the sky.
Shadows lurked in the ditches, bundled together
and plotting some mischief towards him. His
imagination conceived ghastly pictures of men
lying flat in the shadows staring at the heavens
with glazed, unseeing eyes, their throats cut
across from ear to ear.... What a row his
footsteps created! The noise he kicked up must
have echoed across the world. He hummed a
tune viciously and stared intensely into the remoter
darkness of the unknown.</p>

<p class="indent">The breeze whimpered amidst the poplar leaves
and its sigh was carried ever so far away. Again
a shadow swept up from the fields and took shape
on the road in front. Fitzgerald advanced towards
it quickly and collided with a solid mass,
a living form.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good evening,&quot; said a voice with a queer
strange note in it. &quot;You are out late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going back to my billet now,&quot; Fitzgerald
said, and asked: &quot;Where are you going?&quot;
There was a moment&#39;s hesitation before the
stranger replied, saying: &quot;I&#39;m going to the next
village.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald could now see that the man was
dressed as an English soldier in a khaki uniform,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
a rifle over his shoulder and a bandolier round
his chest. Germans often disguise themselves
as British soldiers, Jean Lacroix said....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you belong to?&quot; Fitzgerald asked,
stepping off after the momentary halt. The man
accompanied him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Army Service Corps,&quot; he answered
readily enough, but his accent struck Fitzgerald
as being strangely unfamiliar; in his low guttural
tones there was something foreign. English
could not have been his mother tongue. For a
while there was silence, but suddenly as if overcome
by a sense of embarrassment due to the silence,
the man spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been long in France?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been here for some time,&quot; Fitzgerald
answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your regiment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Being warned against giving any information
to strangers, Fitzgerald gave an evasive reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, a line regiment,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">The man chuckled. &quot;Looks like it,&quot; he said.
&quot;Are you billeted here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m billeted at....&quot; Fitzgerald stopped and
asked &quot;Where are you billeted?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, at the next village,&quot; said the man. &quot;A
number of the A.S.C. are billeted there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
Again a long silence. Their boots crunched
angrily on the roadway and ahead the lights of
war lit up the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re fighting like hell up there,&quot; said the
man. &quot;There&#39;s a big battle on now. Has your
regiment been called up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke he pulled his rifle forward across
his chest and fumbled with the bolt. Fitzgerald
stared at him fascinated, his nerves strained to
an acute pitch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing with your rifle?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; the stranger answered and
slung the weapon over his left shoulder.
Had the man a round in the breech? Fitzgerald
wondered. For himself he had not even a cartridge
in the magazine. What a fool he had been
not to take the precaution of being prepared for
emergencies.... The stranger came close to
his side and his shoulder almost touched Fitzgerald&#39;s.
The Rifleman moved to the left, close
to the verge of the road and his hand slipped
towards his bandolier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s very dark to-night,&quot; he said as his fingers
closed on a cartridge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very dark,&quot; said the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no moon,&quot; Fitzgerald remarked as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
he slipped the bolt of his rifle back. Then with
due caution he pressed the cartridge into the
mouth of the magazine. As far as he could judge
the stranger had not noticed the action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, there&#39;s no moon,&quot; he said in answer to
Fitzgerald&#39;s remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How far is it to the next village?&quot; asked
Fitzgerald and shoved the rounds into the magazine.
The cartridge-clip clattered on to the
cobbles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve dropped something,&quot; said the stranger.
&quot;What was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve dropped nothing,&quot; the Irishman replied.
&quot;I must have hit my boot against something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at the stranger&#39;s face. White and
ghostly it looked, with a protruding jowl and a
dark moustache that drooped over the lips. As
Fitzgerald spoke he pressed the bolt home and
now felt a certain confidence enter his being.
There was the round snug in the breech of his
rifle. One touch of the trigger....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you think I dropped a shilling?&quot; he
laughed. &quot;Wish I had one to throw away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Many a one would wish the same,&quot; said the
man gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he whistled a tune through his teeth, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
contemplative whistle as if he were considering
something.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re at Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm, of course,&quot; he suddenly
remarked. &quot;There are a number of soldiers
billeted there. You know the way to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know the way,&quot; Fitzgerald answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You leave the road at a ruined cottage along
here and cross the fields,&quot; said the man. &quot;I&#39;m
going that way myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I leave the road further along,&quot; the Irishman
said hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the man. &quot;Past the ruined
cottage is the best way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going that way,&quot; Fitzgerald said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not going that way,&quot; repeated his companion.
&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know the road through the fields
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I know the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer to go further along,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;Two of my mates are just ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are they?&quot; asked the stranger in a
tone of surprise. &quot;I thought you were all alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are just a few hundred yards on in
front,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Not so far away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said the man. &quot;Then that is why you&#39;re
in such a hurry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m in no particular hurry,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;But it is wise to be back before &#39;Lights out.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He could see the ruined cottage in front now,
a black blur against the night. The limitless
levels stretched out on either side, frogs croaked
in the ponds, now and then a light shot up from
the fields, trembled in air for a moment and died
away. The breezes of the night, the &quot;unseen
multitude,&quot; as the ancients called them, capered
by, crooning wearily. In front, far ahead, the
artillery fire redoubled in intensity and the sky
was lit by the brilliance of day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hell&#39;s loose out there,&quot; said the stranger.
&quot;It&#39;s not good to be there; it&#39;s not good to die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger turned off the road and walked
a few yards down a lane in the direction of the
cottage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going that way,&quot; said Fitzgerald coming
to a halt. His companion stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid! H&#39;m! I&#39;m not afraid,&quot; the Irishman
answered, nettled at the word. &quot;All right,
you go ahead. I&#39;ll follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man did not move. He fumbled in his
pocket and brought something out, something
dark, small and tipped at the points as if with
silver. Fitzgerald imagined it to be a revolver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
and he slid his rifle forward so that its muzzle
pointed at the man&#39;s body.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold your weapon up, you fool,&quot; said the
stranger, and a note of concern was in his voice.
&quot;I&#39;ve a pocket lamp here. We&#39;ll get off into the
fields now and I&#39;ll light the way with this. The
place is full of ponds and drains. Last night I
fell into a hole somewhere about this place ...
you get off in front.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll follow,&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;You lead the
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; the man meekly responded. &quot;Now
we get off the road.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He slipped into the field and the Irishman
followed. Both were now near the cottage and
they could see its bare rafters and ruined walls
clearly. It looked gloomy and forbidding....
As Fitzgerald gazed at the cottage he saw a light
close to the dark ground; a tremulous flame
gleamed for a moment and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see that?&quot; asked the Irishman. &quot;A
light near the cottage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw nothing,&quot; said his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t see the flame. There&#39;s somebody
in front. Friends of yours maybe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve no friends here.... You saw a light?...
Nonsense!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;There, what is that?&quot; asked the Irishman as
he heard a thud as of somebody falling over a
hurdle. &quot;Did you not hear it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; asked the stranger extinguishing
his torch. &quot;I heard something. Shall
I shout?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; exclaimed the man. &quot;Only to find
out who&#39;s there. Hallo!&quot; he yelled.</p>

<p class="indent">Somebody answered with a loud &quot;hallo!&quot; and
again a light gleamed in the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; shouted the stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s us,&quot; came the answer. &quot;Blurry well lost
in this blurry &#39;ole. &#39;Oo are yer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spudhole!&quot; Fitzgerald shouted in a glad voice
for he recognised the voice of his mate. &quot;Is
Bowdy and the sergeant with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! It&#39;s old Fitz,&quot; Spudhole exclaimed.
&quot;We&#39;re lost, the three o&#39; us, and we don&#39;t know
where we are. D&#39;you know the way to the
farm?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll soon get there,&quot; Fitzgerald replied.
&quot;I&#39;ve somebody with me who knows the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring &#39;im along &#39;ere then,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald turned to his companion who had
just moved to one side, but now he could not see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
him. On his right a dark form became one with
the night and lost itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi!&quot; Fitzgerald shouted. But there was no
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi there!&quot; he cried in a louder voice, but no
answer came back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was somebody with me but he&#39;s gone
now,&quot; he said to Bubb when he reached him
where he stood along with Benners and the sergeant
beside a dark pond near the ruined cottage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we had better try and get back to our
billet,&quot; the sergeant remarked. &quot;Damn these
beastly fields! We&#39;ll be damned unlucky if we
don&#39;t get out o&#39; &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They got into the farmhouse at eleven o&#39;clock.
All their mates were in bed and the watch-dog
at the gate bit Bubb in the upper part of the
thigh as he came in.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald made his way to the barn,
which was above the byre, sat down in
the straw but did not unloosen his puttees
or boots.</p>

<p class="indent">A lamp swinging from a beam lit up the apartment,
showing the straw heaped in the corners,
the sickles and spades hanging from the rafters,
the sleepers lying in all conceivable positions,
the bundles of equipment, the soldiers&#39; rifles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
which stood piled in the corners out of the way.
Now and again a rat glided across the straw,
stood for a moment in the light, peered cautiously
round, and disappeared. The air was full
of the smell of musty wood, of straw, and of the
byre underneath. All was very quiet, little
could be heard save the breathing of the men, the
noise of the restless cattle as they lay down or got
up again. Snoggers and Benners laid themselves
on the straw, Bowdy curled up like a dog, Snoggers
stretched out as stiffly as a statue. Bubb undressed
and Fitzgerald, getting to his feet, applied
sticking plaster to the dog&#39;s bite.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll go mad, you know,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;The only thing that can save you is to get three
hairs of the dog that bit you and put them on
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having performed his job Fitzgerald sat down
and Bubb dressed again. Then he lay on the
straw, both hands in his overcoat pockets, one
leg across the other and a cigarette in his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get down to it, Fitz,&quot; Snogger shouted.
&quot;Ye&#39;re damned slow o&#39; showin&#39; a leg in the mornin&#39;,
you woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all right, Sergeant,&quot; the Irishman replied.
&quot;I&#39;m just goin&#39; to look at a paper. I&#39;ll
be in bed in a twinkling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;Douse the glim &#39;fore you kip, then,&quot; said the
sergeant. &quot;Night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald fumbled in his pocket, brought out
a newspaper and looked at it. His thoughts
seemed to be elsewhere, for his eye, scanning the
printed columns of an advertisement page, turned
from time to time and rested on the face of Sergeant
Snogger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it&#39;s safe now,&quot; said Fitzgerald, when
five minutes had passed. &quot;Old Snogger is snoring.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant was indeed asleep, but had not
lost his military pose. He might have been
frozen stiff while standing to attention on the
parade ground and carried from there into the
barn and placed down just as he had been standing.
Bowdy was fighting Germans in his dreams.
Bubb&#39;s cigarette had fallen on his clothes and
the smell of burning pervaded the barn.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald got to his feet, dropped the newspaper,
lifted the fag-end from Bubb&#39;s overcoat
and turned out the lamp. Then, stepping across
the sleepers, he made his way cautiously to the
door and descended the steps leading to the
farmyard. The night was very quiet; and very
dark. The lights were out in the farmhouse; no
doubt the occupants were all in bed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
&quot;What am I doing out here?&quot; Fitz asked himself.
&quot;I&#39;m drunk, that&#39;s why.&quot; He stood still
and he could feel his heart beating. Something
was moving in the midden and grunting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a pig, I suppose,&quot; said the Irishman.
&quot;They&#39;re all over the place.&quot; Then he thought
of the dog that had bit Bubb. &quot;Will it bite me?&quot;
he questioned and moved hurriedly across the
farmyard towards the gable end of the building.
He stood there for a second to draw breath, then
he went round to the back of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">All were not yet in bed, a light burned behind
a small four-paned window and the shadow of
a girl showed on the blind. Standing a little
distance from the window, Fitzgerald stared at
the shadow, watching its movements. For a
moment he had a view of a face in profile, then
of a head bent down and an arm stretching out
as if pulling a needle from a piece of cloth. The
girl no doubt was mending some clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s Fifi,&quot; said Fitzgerald in a whisper.
His voice was husky and a lump rose in his
throat. &quot;She&#39;s very graceful bending over her
work.... Damn it! I&#39;m in love with her....
If not that, I have a great respect for
her ever since I saw her for the first time....
I suppose I have been a gay Don Juan, but Fifi....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Well, I&#39;ve never felt like this before....
Probably I&#39;m drunk and to-morrow....
But all to-day and yesterday I felt the same....
I don&#39;t think I am drunk for I put the
bandage on with a firm hand.... If she would
open the window and look out only for a moment....
I want to see her; I must see her....
Suppose she spoke to me and then told
Snogger in the morning, told him that I was
hanging about her bedroom window all night,
what would he say?... Oh! damn Snogger,
he&#39;s a fool.... I&#39;ll tap on the pane, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald went up to the window, pressed his
hand softly against the pane, but drew it quickly
away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; he muttered under his breath. &quot;My
God, why have I not more courage ... a gay
Don Juan.... But perhaps she&#39;d do something
awful, throw a tin of water or.... A
gay Don Juan,&quot; he repeated, in a louder voice,
and then added: &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll let her
know I&#39;m here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He raised his hand and tapped lightly on the
pane, then turned, walked off for a distance of a
few yards and stopped. Looking back he saw
the light turned down and heard the window
open. The girl looked out into the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;Who is there?&quot; she called in a low voice.
&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moving quietly, Fitzgerald made his way back
to the window again. The girl could see him
now and apparently recognised him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;English soldier, you should be asleep,&quot; she
said, in a voice charged with laughter. &quot;Go
away. What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want nothing,&quot; said Fitzgerald in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">In the shadows he could see the outline of her
face, which looked strangely white. &quot;I was up
at the Caf&eacute;,&quot; he said. &quot;Coming back I saw the
light, so I tapped.... Is it not time for you
to be in bed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to him!&quot; said the girl, speaking in a
whisper, and bringing her face close to the man&#39;s.
&quot;Time to be in bed, indeed! What does it matter
to you when I go to bed? And I have work
to do. You English soldiers never work....
Go away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are always working, Fifi,&quot; said Fitzgerald,
without moving from where he stood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always working,&quot; repeated the girl. &quot;We
are not like English girls; they never work. They
have too much money. But I must go to bed,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
she said, making as though to shut the window.
&quot;Au revoir, English soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet, not yet!&quot; said Fitzgerald, speaking
hurriedly. &quot;I want to speak to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to say?&quot; asked the girl
in a hesitating voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald was silent. He had so much to say,
but in reality he said nothing at all. He merely
coughed, unbuttoned the pockets of his tunic and
buttoned them up again. He looked at the girl,
and her eyes dropped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to tell me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; Fitzgerald stammered. &quot;I mean....
Au revoir, Fifi.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned round and walked away. When he
got to the corner, he heard her calling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;English soldier, come back,&quot; she said in a
loud whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald was back with her in an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Fifi?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Souvenir pour moi,&quot; she said, in a coaxing
voice. &quot;Jam, hat badges, many souvenirs. Boots
for my father in the trenches. Other soldiers
give me souvenirs often&mdash;but you&mdash;never. The
sergeant gave me a big knife. Also chocolate.
His mother sent it to him from England. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
you, you never give me anything. Will you give
me some souvenirs to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, I will, Fifi,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;Many souvenirs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I&#39;ll give you beer, caf&eacute;-au-lait, several
things,&quot; said the girl, pulling the window a little
way towards her. &quot;Au revoir, English soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She held out her hand, the left, the nearer to
her heart, and Fitzgerald took hold of it. Fifi
looked at him smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in love?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, certainly not,&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;I never
have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; said Fifi. &quot;You English
cannot be trusted. The English girls are
so well dressed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don&#39;t you believe me?&quot; asked Fitzgerald,
pressing her hand, and she made no effort
to withdraw it. &quot;I have never been in love; but
now ... since I have met you ... I would
do anything for you, Fifi. You are the nicest
girl....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, conscience stricken, for his words
seemed so futile. For a moment he paused, and
then a strange thing happened. In all his days
afterwards he could not account for it. How it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
took place was beyond his understanding, but he
had taken Fifi in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifi, I love you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll do anything
for you. After the war, I&#39;ll marry you, come
here and live, or take you to England&mdash;whatever
you desire.... Tell me that you care for me,&quot;
he said, pressing her to his breast.</p>

<p class="indent">Fifi started back like a frightened fawn and
pulled the window to. Almost immediately she
opened it again and looked out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away, English soldier,&quot; she said, but
there was no anger in her voice. &quot;You&#39;re drunk
and you should be in bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald hung around the place for quite an
hour afterwards, hut Fifi did not come to the
window again.</p>

<p class="indent">Early the next morning, after a sleepless night,
he found himself in the house of Josef Babette.
The man himself was away at the war, his wife
and daughter were running the place during his
absence. They had only one servant, a relative
of Madame Babette, an oldish man, lean and
twisted up, with his mouth almost hidden between
nose and chin. But he was a good worker; few
could surpass him at his labour on the wet level
fields. Madame Babette was very industrious,
she got out of bed every morning at five and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
nine at night saw her finishing up the day&#39;s labour.
So from week to week, her toil went on
all the year round. Only on Sunday did she seek
a moment&#39;s relaxation, then she went to church,
told her beads and prayed for her good man who
was away in the trenches fighting the battles of
France.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald was sitting near the stove, writing
up his diary, a habit he contracted at the beginning
of the war and which he was still religiously
pursuing. Mother Babette was washing
her dishes. She was a thin, shrivelled woman of
forty years of age, bent a little through hard
work but still untiring as an ant.</p>

<p class="indent">An adventurous hen was picking up the crumbs
under the chairs. Two chickens, less daring than
their older feathered friend, came in, stalked gingerly
up to their mate, seized each a crumb in
their beaks and ran off as fast as their red legs
could carry them.</p>

<p class="indent">Mother Babette finished her work, wiped the
table, dusted the stove, put the plates on the
dresser and sat down. Fitzgerald continued
writing, but looked up now and again and took
in with his eye the walls blackened with smoke,
the rafters festooned with spider webs, the
strings of onions hanging from the beams, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
tall wooden clock beside the dresser and the dog
which lay under the table, wagging its tail and
shaking its ears as if trying to get rid of
flies....</p>

<p class="indent">Then Fitzgerald&#39;s eyes were attracted by something
else. Outside the door Fifi was standing,
throwing crumbs to the hens which clustered
round her feet. She was a well-built girl of
eighteen with velvety black eyes and a fascinating
face. She wore a grey blouse and a striped
petticoat which reached a little lower than her
knees, strong sabots and a kerchief which was
tied carelessly around her head. A prudent and
hard-working girl, she had already fed the pigs,
foddered and milked the cows, in addition to the
hundred and one little things which must be done
every morning in a farmyard. She was in a
good humour when she entered the house, her
white teeth and bright eyes were made for laughter,
and the girl&#39;s face generally wore a provokingly
coquettish expression. But behind it all
lay hidden a reserve of restraint and dignity
which showed itself when the soldiers, speaking
as soldiers often speak, went too far with an indelicate
jest. Fifi would look steadily, with wide
open eyes, at the speaker for a moment, then
the eyelids would slowly descend and the girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
would rise to her feet and proceed with her work.</p>

<p class="indent">This morning, she went up to Fitzgerald where
he sat beside the stove, writing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To your sweetheart?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The Irishman flushed crimson and closed the
diary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I have no sweetheart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t slept; you look tired,&quot; said Fifi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep. How could I, after last
night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What a fool he had been, he thought. Raving
of love and marriage at the caf&eacute;, then proposing
marriage to Fifi. If Snogger and Bubb and
Bowdy knew all that had happened last night,
what would they say? They would never cease
twitting him. And Fifi. What was she thinking
of now? Of the affair at the window, probably.
He looked up at her. Her eyelids dropped,
but behind this shyness there was something impetuous
and passionate in the whole of her personality.
And he had kissed her last night. He
had pressed those lips in one great kiss. But
now she seemed very far removed from him.
And the souvenirs. The request of the night
before seemed so unworthy of the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You couldn&#39;t sleep last night,&quot; said Fifi.
&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
&quot;I was thinking of you, of all that took place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you were drunk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was not. I remember all that happened.
I have gathered up a lot of souvenirs for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want any,&quot; said the girl. &quot;I was only
joking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no. Have some coffee. Who are you
writing to?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody,&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;It&#39;s part of a
diary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, quite true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not writing to a woman in England?&quot; said
Fifi. &quot;There was a soldier here some time ago.
He used to run after me. And I discovered that
he had a wife in England.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have neither wife nor sweetheart,&quot; said
Fitzgerald. &quot;But if you, Fifi.... I am serious,
you know....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a French soldier came to the
door, a man of about forty-two. Over his
shoulder he carried a kit-bag. Fifi and her
mother ran up to the man and embraced him.
Josef Babette was back home on leave, after
seven months of war. He was a strong-muscled,
well-built man of medium size, a good soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
and diligent worker. He was a well-to-do farmer,
a respectable man, who was trusted by his
neighbours and bounden to none. He placed his
kit away carefully in a corner, bade good morning
to Fitzgerald, and sat down. Fifi brewed a
fresh pot of coffee; Babette spoke about the war.
He had just come from Souchez, and it was a
bad locality. He had never known a spot as
bad. No peace day or night. And as far as he
could see the war would never come to an end.</p>

<p class="indent">He drank his coffee, got to his feet, and went
outside. Fifi, whose eyes were wet with tears
of gladness, lifted the kitbag from the ground
and took it into the bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where has your father gone?&quot; Fitzgerald
asked her when she returned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he has gone out to work,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Things are behindhand on the farm. We have
so little help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald went out into the farmyard. Josef
Babette was harnessing a cart-horse, his coat off
and his shirt-sleeves thrust up over his elbows.
Sergeant Snogger was washing at the pump.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ow&#39;re yer feelin&#39; after last night?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so bad, sergeant,&quot; Fitzgerald replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Been in seein&#39; Fifi?&quot; asked the sergeant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have,&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;She&#39;s a splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
girl. I love her, and if she&#39;ll have me after the
war, I&#39;ll marry her. God! there&#39;s something
grand in her; too good for me. But I don&#39;t know
what to make of her. She won&#39;t trust me, thinks
I&#39;m married, or something like that. And I love
her, but she refuses to understand me. We are
so far apart, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Snogger looked through his soapsuds at Fitzgerald,
astonished at the Irishman&#39;s burst of confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing artificial about the girl,&quot;
Fitzgerald continued. &quot;She is grand, so simple
and original. She says what she thinks and is
far too childish to hide her thoughts. And I
don&#39;t think she has much of an opinion of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think any of these &#39;ere French
wenches care much for an English Tommy,&quot;
said Snogger. &quot;They&#39;ll go a little way wiv &#39;em
and then they turn the deaf ear. I never was
able to fool about wiv &#39;em. They&#39;re more freer
than English birds at first, but it&#39;s &#39;&#39;ands off&#39;
if you want too much. They&#39;re all right if it&#39;s
only cawfee and kisses, but ye&#39;ll never get any
further.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Snoggers winked knowingly and laughed.
Fitzgerald made his way into the barn.</p>

<p class="indent">It was early morning; the soldiers billeted in
Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm were rousing themselves and
making preparations for the march up towards
the firing line. It was now coming towards
the Christmas season; the weather was
cold and rainy, the farmyard damp and muddy,
and a haze rose over the midden in the centre of
the yard. Inside the farmhouse two officers were
sitting down at the only table eating a breakfast
of bread, butter, eggs and tea.</p>

<p class="indent">The soldiers were in the barn preparing their
early meal. The barn seen in daylight was a
cold, bleak, cheerless place, with a broken roof
and rough uneven floor. The men shivered as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
they toiled. They had slept in the cold and felt
frozen when they got up. A big fire had been
lit in the byre beneath; the smoke filled the whole
place and stung the eyes of the soldiers who
worked at the cooking.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger was superintending operations
upstairs and fretting, fuming and coughing.
He was in a very bad temper, having lost a
week&#39;s wages at the gambling table the night
before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Urry up, you men,&quot; he yelled. &quot;I never seed
as slummicky a crush in my natural. Ye&#39;re
slouchin&#39; about same as if ye were in the trenches.
Come on Bowdy! Come on Fitz! Get a blurry
move on, ye Spudhole! Ye&#39;re dowsy, men, ye&#39;re
dowsy! Ye must wake up. We&#39;re off from here
in an hour&#39;s time and we&#39;ve a long march before
us. We&#39;ll be in the trenches for Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are we stopping to-night?&quot; asked
Fitzgerald, who was pouring tea into a messtin
of boiling water, brought up from the byre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the Ritz,&quot; said Snogger with fine irony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard we were billeting at Vinant,&quot; someone
remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought we were bound for Bethune,&quot;
Bowdy Benners said as he lifted a rasher of bacon
from the lid of his messtin.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
&quot;You thought,&quot; spluttered Snogger. &quot;Gawd
Almighty, man, you&#39;re not paid to think in the
army! If you think too much you&#39;ll find yourself
damned unlucky. Anyhow, you&#39;ll find things
hot in the trenches when you get there this time,
I&#39;m telling you,&quot; he continued, lowering his voice.
&quot;There&#39;s big things in the wind. We are going
up by slow stages. I&#39;m glad that we&#39;re goin&#39;.
I don&#39;t like these rests; there&#39;s too much damned
work to do. Give me the trenches when I&#39;m on
the look-out for a cushy time. It&#39;s better than
&#39;ere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant took stock of the apartment with
vigilant eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now this &#39;as to be swept out &#39;fore you go
&#39;way,&quot; he said. &quot;All fag-ends, straw and everything
&#39;as to be cleaned out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot&#39;s the &#39;ell good o&#39; cleaning this caboosh,&quot;
growled Bubb. &quot;It can&#39;t be made clean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s got to be done,&quot; said Snogger, raising
his eyebrows with the decision of a verdict beyond
appeal. &quot;It&#39;s horders, and if horders isn&#39;t
obeyed ye&#39;ll find yourselves damned unlucky....
&#39;As anybody got a fag to spare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Somebody handed the sergeant a cigarette and
he lit it. This seemed to put him in a good humour
and he began relating to Bowdy Benners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
the story of his card-playing the night before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Couldn&#39;t get a card,&quot; he said. &quot;I was dead
off all the night. Once I got a top trotter, but
Sergeant MacManus had a priol of deuces. I
went some money on my &#39;and that go. But
it&#39;s as I&#39;ve always said: &#39;When a man&#39;s luck&#39;s
out s&#39;out, but when it&#39;s in s&#39;in.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant paused as if waiting for the full
wisdom of his remark to sink into Bowdy&#39;s
brain. Then he shouted at the top of his voice,
&quot;Get ready, men, get ready! We&#39;ll soon be movin&#39;
off,&quot; and went out to the farmyard.</p>

<p class="indent">Much work was yet to be done, rifles had to be
cleaned, odds and ends had to be collected from
the straw. Here a knife and fork was found,
there an entrenching tool handle, a tin of bully
beef, a towel and a cake of soap. A great amount
of stuff is lost in large barns; things disappear
mysteriously, lost in the straw or stolen, perhaps,
by the children of the billet. Soldiers treating
themselves to meals at village caf&eacute;s often find
themselves served up with bully beef in new
guise.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside in the farmyard the fowls were standing
on the smoking midden, several of them
scratching the dung with crooked claws in search
of worms. In the midst of the assembly, a rooster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
proud as Lucifer, was clucking amorously.
Now and again he selected a gentle hen, walked
leisurely round her and strove to attract her attention.
The hen would fix a careless but coquettish
look on him, stretch out a wing and
stand on one leg for a moment. Afterwards she
would succumb and the triumphant Sultan would
stretch out his neck and crow a challenge to any
cock that dared to listen.</p>

<p class="indent">At the hour of nine the battalion was ready to
move off. The men were in a good temper now
and full of confidence. The every-day inspection
of equipment had been gone through, rifles had
been examined and the men&#39;s feet looked at.
All were so cool that it was difficult to believe
that they were going up to the trenches, in which
doubtless a number of them would lay down their
lives. Most of the soldiers carried big French
loaves on the back of their packs. The loaves
had been holed through the middle, a string was
placed in the hole and tied to the dees on the
braces.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger made a final inspection of
his platoon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ave yer everything?&quot; he asked, then without
waiting for an answer he went on: &quot;Course yer
should &#39;ave everything. If ye &#39;aven&#39;t ye &#39;aven&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
and that&#39;s all. Here, where the devil is Fitz?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgot somethin&#39; and &#39;e&#39;s gone into the barn,&quot;
Bubb replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see, I see,&quot; said Snogger, winking knowingly.
&quot;Fifi &#39;as gone in too, to &#39;elp &#39;im look for
what &#39;e&#39;s forgot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E&#39;s fair dotty on the bird,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But &#39;e&#39;s forgotten hisself,&quot; Snogger remarked.
&quot;If Captain Thorley finds &#39;im missin&#39;
he&#39;ll be for it. Ah, &#39;ere &#39;e comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald came out from the barn fully
equipped and took his place in the ranks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;re just in time,&quot; said Snogger. &quot;Another
minute late and ye&#39;d be for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald laughed awkwardly and cast a
sheepish glance back at the barn. Fifi was standing
at the door, and Bubb vowed she was crying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fancy &#39;er cryin&#39; cos you&#39;re goin&#39; off, Fitz,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald did not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">The company marched off, the men singing at
the tops of their voices; Spudhole, as was his
wont, leading the singing. He was a most vivacious
youth, full of high spirits and good humour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
fond of his fun and his beer, and as vital
at the end of a journey as at the beginning.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite the distance which a regiment may
travel, the soldier is as circumscribed in his area
as the spoke of a limber wheel. The space is
confined, and Spudhole Bubb was no less a prisoner
on the march than he had been in the guard-room.
Always the same mates in front, the same
ruddy necks pressed sturdily back, the same red-brick
hands swinging across the khaki, the same
entrenching tool handles waving backwards and
forwards, the same round loaves tied to the packs,
the same red-haired sergeant with the tops of his
ears pressing tightly to his head, the same platoon
commander who now and again stood out
from the ranks and shouted the ancient words of
command. &quot;Get a step there, get a step!&quot; or
&quot;Cover off from the front&quot; or some such order.
Once in every hour a whistle was blown and the
whole battalion halted. The Captain of a company
would step out in front, halt, turn about
and shout at the top of his voice, &quot;Ten minutes.
Left of the road. Fall out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men would loosen their equipment and
throw themselves down anywhere. Cigarettes
would be lit, jokes passed, and rations taken out
of haversacks. A few would drink from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
water bottles, sipping the water carefully, for it
was impossible to know when the next pump
would be reached.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the fourth hour and the sixteenth
fag (Spudhole computed the length of a march
by the number of fags he smoked on the route),
Fitzgerald, who had been silent for quite a long
time, turned to Benners and said: &quot;You know,
I had a damned strange dream last night. I
dreamt that I was up in the trenches fighting a
big German who got in my way somehow, and
he ran his bayonet through my neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may get killed this time,&quot; said Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not this time,&quot; Fitzgerald replied. &quot;I
decided that by the cards last night. &#39;Red: I
come back safe; black: I don&#39;t&#39; I said to myself,
cut the cards and turned up the ace of hearts. A
good omen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ear old Fitz!&quot; muttered Spudhole, &quot;&#39;e&#39;s always
pullin&#39; our legs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t understand, Spudhole,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;I&#39;m damned superstitious. Once I
dreamt....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One night I had a dream,&quot; Bubb interrupted.
&quot;Dreamt I was &#39;avin&#39; a feed at the S.P.O.[A] shop.
Next day I was at the street corner a dogger-on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
for flatties. As I was there a copper comes round
the other turnin&#39; and flops into the banker school.
&#39;Twasn&#39;t arf a barney. They sets about &#39;im an&#39;
knocks &#39;im down and I gets &#39;is &#39;at and I kicks it
along the street. Didn&#39;t arf make a big &#39;ole in it
either. But I was unlucky, for two other coppers
comes up and collars me. I was put in the
reformatory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">[Footnote A: Sausage, potato and onion.]</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger detached himself from the
ranks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oo&#39;s got a fag to give away?&quot; he asked as
Fitzgerald came up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s one,&quot; said Fitzgerald, handing the
sergeant a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ave yer &#39;eard about the German as was captured
about &#39;ere the other day?&quot; asked Snogger,
marching by the side of Fitzgerald and lighting
the fag. &quot;&#39;E was got sleeping in a ruined cottage
near the Caf&eacute; Belle Vue. Dressed in khaki,
with the badge of the A.S.C.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God! I must have met that man,&quot; said
Fitzgerald, and told for the first time the story
of his adventure on the night of his return from
the Caf&eacute;.</p>

<p class="indent">He told the story in full, frequently interrupting
himself and going back in the narrative to
present a detail which he had forgotten. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
he had finished he looked at Snogger, who had
listened very attentively, and suddenly realised
that the sergeant did not believe him. To be
sure, Fitzgerald had wandered away a little from
the absolute truth, and the story of his own behaviour
had lost nothing in the telling. A sarcastic
smile showed on Snogger&#39;s lips and Fitzgerald
suddenly wished that the narrative had
never been told.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damned good, or in French, tray bon!&quot; said
the sergeant in a drawling voice. &quot;Blurry fine
story. That A.S.C. bloke told me all about it.
&#39;E was one of our own men, too, not an A.S.C. at
all. You don&#39;t know the feller. &#39;E&#39;s in another
company. But &#39;e&#39;s allus up to a joke. We
planned it all out in the Caf&eacute; after old Fatty &#39;ad
told that cock and bull story about the Germans
breakin&#39; through. The A.S.C. man was to wait
for you on the road outside. Wasn&#39;t that the
ticket, Spudhole?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was &#39;ow we planned it out,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald puffed his cigarette viciously and
his face was crimson. For a moment he was silent,
then he spoke, turning to Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot follow your remark, Bubb,&quot; he said
in a slow voice. &quot;The crash of your falling
aitches drowns all other sounds. You should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
take a lesson in pronunciation from Sergeant
Snogger. If you listen to him when he orders
the &#39;wear wanks to wipe their wifles wiv woily
wags,&#39; you can&#39;t fail to become a master of English
as it is spoken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant blushed red as a beetroot. His
imperfections in speaking were a great eyesore to
the man, and only once before had he been twitted
about the matter. Then thick ears and black
eyes were kept as mementoes of the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">But now he could say nothing; he had given
Fitzgerald sufficient provocation to warrant the
jibe. Without another word he went back to
the head of his platoon. Fitzgerald relapsed into
silence and the march went on.</p>

<p class="indent">At one o&#39;clock came the order &quot;Halt! Left of
the road! Fall out!&quot; And the men sank down
wearily. Their packs were very heavy and their
weight seemed to increase at every yard, justifying
the soldiers&#39; proverb: an ounce at the start
is a pound at the finish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, I don&#39;t know why we carry all this
&#39;ere clobber about wiv us,&quot; Spudhole muttered,
leaning back on his pack and stretching out his
legs to their fullest extent. &quot;Ballyclavvy &#39;elmet,
trench &#39;elmet, gas &#39;elmet and cap,&quot; he enumerated.
&quot;Bay&#39;net, &#39;ipe, trenchin&#39; tool, munition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
(unner and eighty rounds), &#39;ousewife, &#39;oldall,
ground sheet, messtin, razor, soap, comb, towel,
paybook, clasp knife, iron rashuns, knife, fork
and spoon, a bottle of water, a tin of condensed
milk, a tin of caf&eacute;-o-lay, chocolate, matches and
a box o&#39; fags....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll carry yer fags for you if you like,&quot; said
Bowdy Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will yer?&quot; muttered Bubb. &quot;I&#39;ve lost things
that way &#39;fore now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are a lot of things which you haven&#39;t
mentioned yet,&quot; Fitzgerald remarked. &quot;There&#39;s
the first field dressing, the loaf, your overcoat
and spare shirt, pants, socks and vest. By the
way, what are we stopping here for?&quot; he asked.
&quot;There&#39;s no sign of dinner as far as I can see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re damned unlucky about dinner,&quot; said
Snogger, coming up at that moment. &quot;There&#39;s
no dinner, not yet for a while, anyhow. We&#39;re
going away from &#39;ere by buses soon as they come
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where to?&quot; asked Bowdy Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ome,&quot; Snogger answered sarcastically.
&quot;&#39;Ome to the trenches. Big doins up there, I
s&#39;pose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s like the blurry Army,&quot; Bubb remarked
with an air of finality. &quot;Turnin&#39; us out to fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
when we&#39;re just ready for a bit o&#39; grub. I never
could &#39;old with this &#39;ere war. Look, there they
come, curse &#39;em!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An omnibus came in sight, then a second, a
third; coming from a village through which the
battalion had just passed. As the vehicles drew
up the spirits of the soldiers seemed to rise, jokes
were passed with the drivers, mock enquiries
were made and jesting answers were given: &quot;Is
this the bus for Wandsworth?&quot; &quot;Not this one&mdash;next
along this way, No. 32.&quot; &quot;Fares, please.&quot;
&quot;Full inside; room for two on top,&quot; etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The soldiers got on to the buses, which set off
hurriedly when all were aboard. Nobody seemed
to know where the battalion was bound for, but
all anticipated big things ahead. The soldiers&#39;
hearts vibrated with a strange expectant thrill&mdash;something
great was going to happen. Where?
When? The men asked one another, but none
could answer the questions. They stood on the
threshold of great events; children outside the
door of a chamber of mysteries.</p>

<p class="indent">The men moved wearily, grunting and
stumbling, their uniforms muddy and
dirty, their rifles held at all angles. Now
and again one would stand still for a moment,
look round, readjust his equipment braces and
continue marching. On all faces was a sluggish
indifferent look: the march from Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm
had begun centuries ago and would never end.
They kept walking and walking, drowsily heedless
of all that went on around them.</p>

<p class="indent">Although midwinter the day had seemed very
close, the night seemed closer still. The men
sweated as they marched. The silence was profound,
hopeless and oppressive. The crunching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
boots were part of the eternal monotonous silence;
when the column halted the cessation of
movement came like a blow and almost stunned
them as they stood. Where was the battalion
going to? Nobody seemed to know and nobody
cared now. Weariness had killed the men&#39;s curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger came along on the right
flank of his company during one of these stoppages;
his feet moving ponderously, his back
crooked like an old man&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; somebody asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Feel to the left or you&#39;ll be damned unlucky,&quot;
he said. &quot;Reinforcements!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His voice was almost incoherent and his tones
were charged with impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">Dark bulks took shape on their right, creaked
and thundered for a moment, then vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Reinforcements!&quot; someone muttered, and
added: &quot;On buses, London buses. Same as we
came on t&#39;other day. And we&#39;ve been marching
nearly all the time since then!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the living body crawled forward step by
step. Bubb leant forward on Fitzgerald&#39;s arm,
fell asleep but still continued his march. Fitz
could feel Bubb&#39;s hand on his own; it was soft
and warm but very heavy. He tried to shake it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
off but it clung tighter.... Why was it done
to him? The Irishman was not conscious of
having done any wrong. But to press his hand
with pincers and crush him down with a steam
hammer&mdash;it was too much.... He was falling
through space with a monstrous load on his
shoulders. Down, down, ever so far down and
no bottom. The fall was endless. A branch of
a tree stretched out towards his hand and he
strove to grip it. It evaded him and he still fell.... Fitzgerald
suddenly bounced into conscious
life to see figures moving forward right
in front of him. Then he knew that he was still
marching, marching up to battle. &quot;What battle?&quot;
he asked himself, and then became annoyed
at his own curiosity. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he
muttered. &quot;What the hell does it matter, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sleepy?&quot; asked Bubb, who had woke
up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; the Irishman answered unconcernedly.
&quot;Please take your hand away! Take it away at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb paid no heed but his hand gripped tighter
still. Fitz tried to shake it off, but the effort
was monstrously futile. But what did it matter?
He was living in a confused and muddled nightmare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
and his mind was a great vacant chamber
filled with spectres more impalpable than air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The lights!&quot; somebody said. &quot;Look at
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The starshells seemed very near, blazing in
the heavens, green, red and white. The green
was restful to look upon, the white hard and cold;
the red starshells were lurid wounds dripping
with blood. Fitz shuddered and his eyes sought
the ground again....</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;On the left of the road, fall out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The command was given in a weak voice and
the men dropped down on the withered grass. It
was now almost dawn; the ambulance waggons
were tearing along the road and the wounded
could be heard groaning and cursing as the vehicles
were jolted from side to side on the cobbled
way.</p>

<p class="indent">The battle to which the London Boys were
going was at an end now. The soldiers were
dimly conscious of this but all were indifferent
to the result of the conflict.... Most of the
men were already asleep. A cold breeze was
blowing and high up in the air the starshells were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
still blazing merrily over the firing line....
Soldiers came tottering back from battle in platoons,
in squads, in pairs. They were all war-worn
and dejected, they straggled by, their heads
sunk on their breasts. Now and again the men
spoke to them, but they seldom made answer and
when they replied their answers were ever the
same.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Boche attacked,&quot; they said. &quot;Christ! he
didn&#39;t half send some stuff across &#39;fore he came
over. We chased him back. But &#39;twas a fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald lay close to the earth and he could
smell the moist clay and dead grass. It was very
cold too. He turned over on his side and stretched
out his legs to their full extent. It was now on
the fringe of dawn....</p>

<p class="indent">The earth grew pale and objects in the near
distance took on definite form....</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald woke with a start and got to his
feet. He had been asleep for a few minutes only.
His mates were buckling their belts and grumbling
at their lot. What was going to happen
now? Going back again and all that damned trek
for nothing. Not one of them could march another
hundred yards....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re not going far back,&quot; Snogger said.
&quot;Just a mile or so and we&#39;ll billet at a village.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Then you can all &#39;ave a kip. That&#39;s if ye&#39;re
lucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the attack?&quot; Fitz asked. &quot;Was it
beaten off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;The Germans got
as far as our trench and there they stopped;
some of them for good. We&#39;re lucky we weren&#39;t
in it, I&#39;m thinking.... Come on, boys, and
pull yourselves together,&quot; he shouted. &quot;We&#39;ve
got to get out of this before it gets too clear.
It&#39;ll soon be broad daylight, and we&#39;ll be damned
unlucky if we&#39;re &#39;ere then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wounded men who were able to walk straggled
along the road. When they fell they fell
silently and got up mutely. But many fell and
did not rise.</p>

<p class="indent">The men were well on their way when dawn
broke, and the rim of the sky flushed crimson.
Dead mules lay on the cobbled ways, torn with
ghastly wounds; drivers in khaki, helplessly impotent,
lay huddled amidst their broken limbers.
The roadway was gutted by shells and the poplars
that lined the path were scarred and peeled
by many a projectile. Behind, the shells were
bursting and the sound of explosions quivered
through the crisp clear air.</p>

<p class="indent">If the men looked back they could see the hills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
behind, rising out of the dawn, the white mists
in the Zouave valley&mdash;the valley of Death, the
Cabaret Rouge, the inn on the Souchez Road,
and Souchez itself which is now a heap of powdered
dust. War had rent and riven many a
village but Souchez it had powdered to dust. Not
the fragment of a single wall remained standing
and not a whole brick remained of the village
of Souchez.</p>

<p class="indent">Higher than any of the hills of Lorrette rose
&quot;The Pimple,&quot; the highest peak in the district.
From the top mile after mile of the surrounding
country was visible&mdash;woods, roads, towns, villages
and canals. The French were supposed to
be holding it.</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger, who had been marching in
front, came back and kept in step with Bowdy
Benners and his mates.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The French lost &#39;The Pimple&#39; last night,&quot; he
said. &quot;There were two thousand &#39;oldin&#39; the place
and the Germans turned every damned gun
they&#39;d got on it. Blew it to blazes, they did.
Not one Frenchman came back; and they say
none was taken prisoners. They were damned
unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half-an-hour&#39;s march brought the men to a
little village, broken, ruined, untenanted. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
they halted while the officers inspected the cellars,
seeking shelter where their men might sleep.
Snogger&#39;s friends were lucky and found a cellar,
the floor of which was littered with hay, and
here they lay down, but not before they lit a candle
to frighten the rats away. Holding himself
erect, Snogger tried to unbuckle his equipment,
but his fingers were unable to perform the task.
&quot;Damn it!&quot; he shouted in a petulant voice and
collapsed in a heap on the straw where he lay
crumpled up. He might have been hit in the
head by a bullet so sudden was his fall.</p>

<p class="indent">The men lay near the bottom of the cellar
stairs; the apartment lost itself in unfathomable
corners, and there the rats were scurrying backwards
and forwards. Bowdy was just dropping
off to sleep when a hoarse sepulchral yell echoed
through the cellar and a strange unearthly figure
rushed into the circle of candle-light, waving his
arms in the air and shouting in a strange incoherent
voice. The men were looking at a French
soldier.</p>

<p class="indent">He came to a halt at the foot of the stairs; his
eyelids slowly opened, the eyes took in the apartment&mdash;the
dim candle, the forms lying on the
floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked in a steady voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Then as if collecting his scattered wits he muttered:
&quot;You are billeted here. I have just come
down from the &#39;Pimple&#39;.... I&#39;m the only man
left.... Who has a drop of water to spare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus did Fitzgerald, who woke up, translate
the man&#39;s remarks. Bowdy gave him a drink of
water. He lay down again in one of the men&#39;s
overcoats and was soon asleep. As the men
dozed off one by one the rats drew closer, peering
curiously out from the darkness of the remote
corners of the cellar.... Fitzgerald fell
asleep to awake suddenly with a start. A rat
had run over his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The damned pests,&quot; he muttered getting to
his feet. &quot;I can&#39;t stand them. I&#39;ll get outside
and sleep on the ground. God! it&#39;s strange how
a little thing like a rat disturbs me,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">He went outside, lay down on the cobbles and
slept the sleep of a weary man.</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening the battalion marched away
from the neighbourhood of Souchez and entered
the Loos Salient just in time for the Christmas
season.</p>

<p class="indent">It was about seven o&#39;clock in the evening and
an unusual silence brooded over the Loos
Salient. In the trenches the silence always
broods; the soldiers, not knowing what the moment
may bring forth, are uneasy; and the eternal
hidden menace of the Unknown is intensified
by the stillness. The evening was intensely
dark; black, impenetrable shadows bulked in the
trenches and became the colour of the parapet,
parados and bay. Objects quite near at hand
took on strange fantastic shapes and looked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
men lying asleep on the firesteps; only a closer
examination would show that the phantoms were
sandbags or ammunition boxes. Many of the
boys were smoking; the lighted cigarettes glowed
like rubies set in an illimitable spread of ebony.</p>

<p class="indent">It was raining; a soft, almost caressing rain
dropped sleekly and helplessly down on the firing
line. In this manner it had been falling for
hours; the trenches were filled to the firestep with
slush and muck; the duck-boards were afloat, and
men changing their position in the trench clambered
out over the top and walked along the
reverse slope of the parapet. Now and again a
wayfarer stuck in the clinging quicksand of the
trench floor, only to free himself when he succeeded
in climbing out of his Wellington boots.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald sat down on the firestep and sank
into the soft mud. So complete was the stillness
that he could distinctly hear all the varied sounds
of the night mingling together in a long-drawn,
slumberous murmur. The far-off death lullaby
of a heavy shell, the soft, quivering croon of the
damp wind, the sough of a boot as a soldier
walked along the trench; the vague murmurings
from a near dug-out, the enervating sizzle of
falling rain, and the varied, indefinable night
movements of Nature blended sleepily together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
in a slumber that made for nightmares and fevered
dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald dozed off, only to wake in an instant
by hearing voices speaking very close to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spudhole, my rifle is full of dirt; half a sandbag
of chalk has gone down the barrel,&quot; said
the voice of Bowdy Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mine is full up o&#39; muck, too,&quot; said Spudhole.
There was an indifference in his tones. He
seemed to have lost all interest in his best friend,
his &quot;&#39;ipe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care a damn,&quot; he muttered. &quot;A
nipe&#39;s only made to be cleaned in this &#39;ere war
as far as I can see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When is the rum coming up?&quot; Bowdy enquired.
&quot;Probably we&#39;ll get none to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;S&#39;up,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;round the next bay in
the dug-out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m off,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;I&#39;m half
frozen. I&#39;m for a good tot if it&#39;s going....
By the way,&quot; he asked, as if it had suddenly occurred
to him, &quot;how many of our fellows were
blown up by the mine this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seven or eight,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;or maybe more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And to think that to-night&#39;s Christmas Eve,&quot;
said Benners, as if the conversation had forcibly
reminded him of the fact.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
The two men clambered over the top and made
their way towards the dug-out from which the
rum was issued.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald got up and followed.</p>

<p class="indent">As he crawled over the sandbags a starshell
rose into the darkness and lit the scene of war.
The country showed wet and livid, the barbed
wire entanglements wound crookedly along the
levels. The wires stretched out waiting for their
prey with threatening barbs.</p>

<p class="indent">In the brooding silence and the locality of war,
Hate and Vengeance persisted, and were well in
keeping with the ominous night, and here it
seemed they found their most direct expression.
Fitzgerald looked around, and queer, fragmentary
thoughts rioted in his head. He remembered
a verse of a song which he had once heard, and
repeated it aloud.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Here comes I, Jack Straw;</span><br />

<span class="i0">Give me a kiss or leave me alone.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has put this nonsense into my mind?&quot;
he asked himself. &quot;Probably it is because it is
part of a Christmas carol.... And this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
Christmas eve.... Two thousand years gone
by and the message of the Prince of Peace not
made manifest yet.... Well, I wonder if the
rum is waiting...?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made his way into the trench again, and
came in sight of the dug-out, with its candle lit
in a niche of the chalky wall, and its huddled
occupants lying on the floor. A few, no doubt,
were asleep. Two or three were sitting, their
backs against the chalk, their heads bent down
almost between their knees. All were dressed
in sheepskin coats, khaki trousers and high boots,
and wore full equipment, their cartridge pouches
being well stocked with ammunition. Although
a bank of earth was heaped up on the doorstep,
it did not prevent the water from dripping inside.
The floor of the dug-out was as mucky as the
floor of the trench. Stooping down, Fitzgerald
crawled in through the narrow door of the
shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb was already inside, scraping the muck
from his boots with a clasp knife. Behind him,
with his back against the wall, sat Bowdy Benners,
cutting a lump of cheese into small portions.</p>

<p class="indent">The cheese was a big item of the Christmas
Eve rations.</p>

<p class="indent">He was sitting down now, his head thrust forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
his big hands busy with the cheese. As
Fitzgerald entered he looked up, then glanced
round the dug-out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much grub to-night, boys,&quot; he said.
&quot;Four biscuits, a half a tin of bully and a piece
of cheese for each man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the rum?&quot; asked Bubb, forestalling
every man with the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s here all right,&quot; said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">They stared open-mouthed for a full second,
then a roar of delight echoed through the dug-out
and the sleepers awoke. Bubb rose to his
feet, whirled his clasp knife round his hand, endeavoured
to dance a jig, and only stopped when
his head came in forcible contact with the roof
for the third time. Fitzgerald chuckled; a glow
of satisfaction lit up his handsome face, and his
eyes rested lovingly on the sandbag which stood
in an angle of the wall near the door. Then he
lay back, rested his head on the wall and stared
at the candle. In that position he looked a very
charming boy, and he knew it. In civil life he
must have been very fond of society, the company
of notable people, and above all of pretty women.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he looked at the sandbag in the angle
of the wall, but his eyes were not the only ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
fixed on that object. And no wonder: the sandbag
contained the rum jar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, wot about a tot?&quot; asked Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy rose and took the sandbag into the middle
of the room, where he uncovered the precious
jar and filled a mess-tin of liquor. He handed
the tin to Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheero!&quot; said the Cockney, and drank. He
passed the tin round and wiped his lips.
&quot;There&#39;s some guts in rum,&quot; he muttered, and
his voice was full of emotion. &quot;Gawd! it doesn&#39;t
&#39;arf warm up the inside of a bloke. Now, wot
about a Christmas dinner?&quot; he continued.
&quot;Bully ain&#39;t wot one would call tr&egrave;s bon, is it?
Christmas dinner of bully beef! Gor&#39;blimey!
that&#39;s no blurry good!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a funny thing that a full belly always is
associated with happiness,&quot; said Fitzgerald,
shaking his head and laughing loudly. Rum
went easily to his head. &quot;If a man gets married,
he feeds well, and if a child is born to him,
he stuffs himself with viands. It&#39;s always his
belly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always,&quot; said Bubb, reaching a second time
for the mess-tin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what Fitz says,&quot; remarked
Bowdy Benners, sinking his chin into the collar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
of his sheepskin coat. &quot;What I say is this: We
must have a Christmas dinner to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can we get one?&quot; Fitz enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Easy enough that,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;I know
an old woman of the Caf&eacute; Calomphie. A parcel
of good things could be got there for a few
francs. I could go down to Les Brebis in an
hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they&#39;re shelling the road,&quot; Fitzgerald
remarked. &quot;Blowing holes in it, and the houses
are flying about the streets. Not only that, but
you&#39;re not supposed to go away from here. And
again, all shops are closed at nine o&#39;clock. It&#39;s
well past eight now....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;The
woman of the caf&eacute; is a great friend of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;re a sly old dawg, Bowdy,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;No one &#39;ud fink that to look at yer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy went red in the face, and proceeded to
buckle his equipment, his hands trembling a little
over the job.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll have a collection, anyhow,&quot; said Fitzgerald,
and he flung a coin into his mess-tin.
Several coins followed, and in the end the magnificent
sum of twelve francs fifty was collected.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy put the money in his pocket, took a last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
long-drawn pull at his cigarette, and went outside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be back again in no time,&quot; were his final
words.</p>

<p class="indent">The men turned their attention to the rum jar
again; tongues were loosened and stories of past
Christmases went round the dug-out. Bubb,
strong on the traditions of the regiment, told the
story of the Brigadier&#39;s kit inspection at St. Albans
the Christmas previous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The &#39;ole Brig come round when &#39;e was inspectin&#39;
us, and &#39;e looked at my pack,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;&#39;That&#39;s the neatest pack I&#39;ve seed in the &#39;ole
battalion,&#39; says the Brig. &#39;&#39;Ave yer got everything
that&#39;s laid down in orders in that &#39;ere pack?&#39;
&#39;e says to me. &#39;Everything,&#39; I sez. &#39;I know that
the contents of a nice pack is always nice and
clean,&#39; &#39;e says. &#39;I&#39;ll just &#39;ave a look at yer pack.
Take it off and take out everything and lay them
out,&#39; &#39;e says. Gor&#39; blimey! I did wot &#39;e ordered
me, an&#39; my bloomin&#39; pack was full of straw.
&#39;Twas lighter to carry than the or&#39;nary caboosh.
Fourteen days&#39; spudhole,&quot; Bubb concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald was singing a song and waving an
empty mess-tin over his head. The song was
one of his own making, a Rabelaisian production
with a snappy chorus. All joined in and drank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
in turn. Suddenly they heard the dull rumble
of approaching shells and the loud explosions of
the missiles in the fields outside. Fitzgerald lit
a cigarette and finished a chorus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re strafing again,&quot; he said. &quot;The
damned pastime will never come to an end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dawn was at hand, the dawn of
Christmas Day. Fitzgerald was standing
on the firestep looking over No Man&#39;s
Land towards the enemy&#39;s trenches. It was his
hour on sentry-go. The rain was still falling,
and his hands and feet felt very cold, but he was
powerless to restore any warmth to his body by
moving about. To leave the firestep for a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
was dangerous. He knew that if he stuck
in the mud of the trench he could not extricate
himself, for he felt utterly worn out. He had
been warm enough when he went on watch owing
to the rum which he had drunk, but now he was
shivering as if his whole being had been stricken
with ague. He tried to warm his legs by striking
one against the other, but his feet felt so heavy
that he desisted after two or three ineffectual
endeavours to release them from the mud. The
slightest movement was a monstrous futility, and
now that it had become so difficult to move he did
not want to remain still, and he had the greatest
desire in the world to be free-footed and doing
something.</p>

<p class="indent">The Germans were shelling the sector on the
right, and the chill, wet morning was lit up by
the lurid flashes of bursting explosives. The air
was full of the rumbling and crashing of the conflict;
shells sped across the trench, careering towards
some distant objective, probably the village,
where old Bowdy was routing out the essentials
for a Christmas dinner. And Bowdy
had not returned yet; some nine hours had gone
by since he departed on his mission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably he has got blown to pieces,&quot; Fitzgerald
muttered. &quot;Poor old Bowdy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
Then he passed, without further thought of
Bowdy, to memories which came into his head
at random. He thought of his home, away up
a little glen in Galway, of the neighbours there,
of Doalty Fadhan, the great gambler, who always
won when he turned his coat outside in, of
Eamon Hudagh, who got drunk at Glenagh Fair
and lost his clothes somewhere at night; in the
morning he came across the hills in a red flannel
petticoat; of Paddy Brogan who cleared out the
same fair with a stone in the foot of a woman&#39;s
stocking. &quot;I wish I was in Glenagh now,&quot; Fitzgerald
said. &quot;A good turf fire, a bit and a sup
and the neighbours coming in for the night&#39;s
raking.&quot; Then all these memories and desires
floated together and jumbled themselves up in his
head, and he fell asleep. He was awakened by
a feeling that everything was not as it should
be. For the unusual there was only one place
to look, out on his front, and his eyes were already
fixed on the grey, formless level which lay
between his trench and the enemy&#39;s. Nothing
changed there, everything just.... Then Fitzgerald
saw a huge bulk take shape on his right
front, twenty yards from the trench and fifty
yards away from the spot where he stood. The
bulk rose upright, like a gigantic monster of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
pre-Adamite age, paused for a second as if considering
something, then it burst in twain, and
Fitzgerald flopped down into the mucky trench,
half blinded and deafened by the flash and thunder
of the exploding mine.</p>

<p class="indent">The earth had vomited its entrails out, a million
rocks rioted through the air and ricochetted
off the parapet; the dawn was thick with flying
rubbish, the greater part of which seemed to be
falling into the trench, dropping with a sickly
splosh into the muck. The world was falling
down around the ears of the Irishman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Out and man the mine crater!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The order came along the trench like a half
strangled whisper. Fitzgerald rose from the
muck and spluttered the message along to the
next bay, then gripped his rifle and clambered up
and across the parapet.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the men were already out and rushing
towards the crater of the mine. Fitzgerald had
a vivid impression of flying figures in sheepskin
coats, of rifles in air, of bursting shells, of men
stumbling, falling and rising, of hoarse-voiced
oaths and imprecations, of queries and answers.
&quot;Not our mine, is it?&quot; &quot;I thought we were too
far apart.&quot; &quot;Are we to get into the blurry &#39;ole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&#39;fore the gas clears away?&quot; were a few of the remarks
which came to his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">A corporal halted near him and shouted something
about the risk the men were running.
&quot;We&#39;ll be poisoned by the fumes in the crater,&quot;
he said. &quot;We&#39;re coming across too soon. Far
too soon,&quot; he muttered; &quot;far too blurry soon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But no one paid any heed. To stop on the
open was dangerous, and the Germans were out
already. They could be seen, dark figures breaking
through the enemy&#39;s barbed wire entanglements.
Presently they would be engaged with
the British in a hand-to-hand encounter for the
possession of the crater.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald reached the rim of the hole and
stood there for a moment looking down. Heavy
coils of thick smoke wound snake-like along the
bottom, where the black earth was illumined by
ghastly phosphorescent lights that trailed up the
sides in thin sluggish streaks. A few soldiers
were already going down into the place and halting
from time to time, taking stock of the scene
before them. All were spluttering and coughing,
and a few had pulled their gas helmets down over
their heads and faces. &quot;This is no blurry bean-fast,
I can tell yer,&quot; Spudhole muttered as he
tried to clamber back, crawling with difficulty almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
knee-deep in the rubble. As he moved the
clay shot away from beneath him, and he found
himself in the unenviable plight of being able to
advance a foot, only to find himself slipping back
a yard.</p>

<p class="indent">The enemy shelled with unceasing persistency,
and men were getting struck on the rim of the
crater. Anywhere was better than where they
were standing&mdash;they flopped into the crater, making
futile efforts to save themselves, from rolling
to the bottom, by clawing at the clay of the
sides. Once down, however, they found to their
relief that breathing was easier than they had
anticipated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What now?&quot; somebody enquired, looking
vaguely round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What indeed? What&#39;s to be done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll get killed like blurry rats down &#39;ere....
The Alleymongs are coming over in
droves....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s better to fight them on the top than to
let them stone us to death down here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger, in a sheepskin coat, which
was freshly ripped across the shoulder by a bullet
or shell splinter, rolled down the side of the
crater and landed at the bottom. In a moment
he was on his feet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;Up to the top, boys!&quot; he cried. &quot;Don&#39;t stand
here arguing like fishwives. Up to the top or
you&#39;ll be damned unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately the men were crawling up like
ants, but with extreme difficulty. Their heavy
boots, their equipments and rifles impeded their
movements, each man was a khaki-clad Sisyphus,
battling against an incline such as the patient
Sisyphus never experienced. The men, grunting
and swearing, seemed to be making no headway,
the scaling of the craterside, about sixty feet in
depth, was a Herculean task for men strong of
wind and limb, for them it was a task of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll never get there,&quot; Bubb grunted. Then
his eyes sought the top. &quot;Gor&#39; blimey!&quot; he muttered,
&quot;there they come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A man, dressed in German uniform, stood on
the rim of the crater, a rifle in his hand, and
looked down. As the soldiers watched, he raised
his rifle to his shoulder and pointed it at the crush
in the bottom of the crater.</p>

<p class="indent">The movement was his last. Bowdy Benners
arrived at that moment, dressed in full marching
order, his rifle in his hand and the bayonet fixed.
The &quot;point&quot; was delivered at the shoulder, and
Benners&#39; long arms put all the zest of a strong
body into the movement. The German came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
clean over the rim of the crater and rolled down
to the bottom, clawing at the air with frenzied
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy lay down at the top, and his rifle became
active. Round after round sped across the open
towards the foe, who were now coming up in
bulk and getting very close to the crater.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep it up, Bowdy!&quot; cried Snogger. &quot;Are
they near?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re not far away,&quot; said Bowdy without
looking round. &quot;Devil blow me blind, they&#39;ll be
here in a second if you don&#39;t come up and give
me a hand.... Ha! They&#39;ve stopped now,
a shell has caught a couple.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, Bowdy, we&#39;re here,&quot; the sergeant
shouted reaching the summit.</p>

<p class="indent">The main body of Germans, advancing in open
order, was still some fifty yards away. As far
as could be ascertained at the moment, the delay
(they should have been across the open three minutes
ago) was due to a heavy curtain fire which
had greeted them just as they came out of their
trenches. The fire caught them at the barbed
wire entanglements, concussion shells tore up
the wires and swept them around the bodies of
the attackers, and the impartial shrapnel rained
viciously down on the huddled heaps of wounded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
The quick were advancing, a dispirited party
of men, in open order, glad to get away from
their own trenches, which were suffering cruel
chastisement. Some were willing to fight even
yet; five or six had flung themselves down on the
ground and trained their rifles on the British positions,
opening a wild erratic fire of slight intensity.
Cold hands never hold a rifle steady on a
Christmas morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The men in the crater lay down behind the parapet
which the exploding mine had formed and
opened fire with deadly effect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;ll knock the blurry stuffin&#39; out o&#39; them,&quot;
Spudhole remarked. &quot;There they come now,
their &#39;ands up in the air.&quot; It was even as he remarked.
The advanced line of Germans put their
timorous hands over their heads and stepped diffidently
towards the mine. &quot;Kamerad! Kamerad!&quot;
they whined, their arms shaking as if
stricken with palsy. The snipers threw their
rifles away and joined in with their mates. All
were sick of the job.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take them prisoners,&quot; said Sergeant Snogger.
&quot;There&#39;s nothing else to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later when the wounded had been
carried back to the trench and the prisoners were
marched off to the village at the rear, the victors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
were left to themselves, in undisputed possession
of their hard-won crater.</p>

<p class="indent">The Christmas morning scene was one never to
be forgotten: the rain-swept crater, the crumbling
clay, the fumes of gunpowder, the dead bodies,
the monotonous hum of ragtime choruses,
the shells bursting across the top, the dirty rifles
and the dirtier men who endeavoured to clean
them. Bowdy Benners was there with a full pack
and a bulging haversack. Fitzgerald and Spudhole
were deep in a discussion on some nonsensical
subject; but the discussion served its object,
it brought the men&#39;s minds away from the stark
reality of their surroundings. Snogger sitting on
his haunches, was giving details of the fight to
his platoon commander, Captain Thorley.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb drew up towards Bowdy and asked him
for a drink from his water-bottle. Benners
handed it to him with a solemn look. Spudhole
drank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good?&quot; asked Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonderful stuff,&quot; said Spudhole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hand it round,&quot; said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">All drank from the water bottle in turn, and
each man winked knowingly when he drank.
None of the men had expected any rum that
morning, the rations of the night before had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
so short; the limbers met with a mishap when
coming up to the Vall&eacute; Dump. Of course, all
were aware that Bowdy had come into possession
of the rum by illegitimate means. However, no
enquiries were made.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now what about a smoke before dinner?&quot;
Bubb remarked, fixing a knowing glance on
Bowdy. &quot;&#39;As anybody got a fag to spare?
Many a pore bloke &#39;as &#39;gone West&#39; since I &#39;ad
my last fag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald fumbled about in his haversack and
found a box, a little tin box, lying snug and dry
amidst a crush of papers and broken biscuits.
Some fifty cigarettes were enclosed within. He
handed them round.</p>

<p class="indent">They lit them up. The drink and the smoke
exercised a cheering effect upon the men. A look
of pleasure stole over every face and the men
burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter when
Spudhole, standing on a platform of clay, placed
his arms akimbo and wished all a merry Christmas.
&quot;If we &#39;ave to spend the day &#39;ere, we must
spend it &#39;ere, we must stick it &#39;ere, and there&#39;s
no more to be said,&quot; he laughed. &quot;We&#39;ll get relieved
to-night,&quot; he added; &quot;that&#39;s if we&#39;re
lucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose we build a dug-out and light a fire,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
said Snogger. &quot;There&#39;s &#39;arf-a-dozen poles standin&#39;
over the top; we&#39;ve got waterproof sheets,
trenchin&#39; tools and good chalk to work in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Drawing their tools from their equipment, the
men set to labour with zeal, hollowed out a shelter
in the chalk, roofed it over and lit a fire. The
latter was the most difficult feat, and several entrenching
tool handles had to be cut into thin
spales and placed over the flames before the fire
burned properly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Devil blow me blind if that&#39;s not very clever,&quot;
said Bowdy Benners when the flames were dancing
merrily against the wall of the dugout. &quot;It
almost puts me in mind of Christmas away in
Blighty. Now we&#39;ll see what we&#39;ve in hand for
a meal for our Christmas dinner. I&#39;ll look in my
pack.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened his pack and took out the treasures,
which he piled against the wall of the dug-out.
The pack contained three large loaves, cut into
thick chunks, eight tins of sardines, a tin of condensed
caf&eacute;-au-lait, two bottles of champagne
and several slabs of Menier&#39;s chocolate. The
bulging haversack was another treasure wallet;
it contained apples and pastry in abundance, also
a tin of lard, which would presently be used for
frying bully beef.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
During all the morning the artillery fire had
not wholly slackened, but now a quiet moment
held the line. Dinner was prepared. First the
men made tea, using the water from their water-bottles
and boiling it in mess-tins over the fire.
Then they cooked their bully beef on the mess-tin
lids and cut the bread into nice thin slices.
It was Fitzgerald who proposed that all slices
should be thin, and none gainsaid his whim. The
first course consisted of sardines and bread; the
second course of bread and fried bully. Tea was
served with every course. Followed pastry for
dessert, and fruit was served out in dainty portions.
They brought the meal to an end by drinking
French wine and English rum, and lighting
up their cigarettes.</p>

<p class="indent">During the meal the platoon commander was
deep in talk with Sergeant Snogger and when the
Christmas dinner was over he came forward and
spoke to the party.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My boys,&quot; he said, &quot;this, I suppose, is the
most interesting Christmas you&#39;ve ever spent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb: &quot;Too interestin&#39; for me, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Platoon Commander: &quot;Yes, I suppose it is.
But I hope that neither you nor any of us will
spend Christmas under such conditions again.
Such things must be at times, I suppose, and seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
that it came to our turn, I must admit that
we did as well as any platoon in the British Army.
You stuck to your posts like bricks and reaped
honours from a fight where the odds were very
much against us. Rifleman Benners at a critical
moment showed great resource in putting one
of the enemy out of action. For this we must
thank him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Platoon: &quot;Hear, hear. Good old Bowdy!&quot;
etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Platoon Commander: &quot;I haven&#39;t much further
to say except that I&#39;m going to recommend
Rifleman Benners for the D.C.M. I am not going
to make any inquiries as to where he spent
last night and the early hours of this morning.
As all you men assert that he was in the trenches
I&#39;ll take your word for it! I&#39;m not going to inquire
where the champagne, bread and other
things came from, but if I may, I&#39;ll say that I&#39;ve
never in all my life enjoyed a meal half as well
as I enjoyed my Christmas dinner in the Loos
Salient.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That night the Irish were relieved.</p>

<p class="indent">A month later the D.C.M. was given to Bowdy
Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">The dark night clung close to the wet levels
of No Man&#39;s Land, and a breeze
whimpered across the grasses, crooning
wearily. The whole world seemed tired; the star-shells
rose lazily over the German trenches,
burned drowsily for a space, and fell sluggishly
to earth. The light failing, the circle of horizon
grew less, and objects quite close at hand became
hidden from view. The hour was about ten, and
Bowdy Benners felt tired and sleepy. He was
sick of it all&mdash;the night raids, the attacks, and
bombing encounters. His mind turned to home&mdash;quiet
London&mdash;the peaceful houses, the easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
nights of untroubled sleep, afternoon teas, and
the hundred-and-one comforts of civil life which
were so far removed from him at the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be ten now,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I suppose
I&#39;ll get relieved presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door of a near dug-out opened, and the
ray of a candle shone out into the trench. One
of his mates came out, his rifle in his hand, his
waterproof ground-sheet over his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you, Bubb?&quot; he asked. &quot;Taking a
turn as sentry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; Bubb answered. &quot;Thought I
wasn&#39;t coming out, eh? Are you fed up?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A bit sick of it,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;I&#39;m tired of
looking across the parapet day and night. How
do you like it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rotten,&quot; said Spudhole. &quot;The weather is so
damned rotten! Everything&#39;s rotten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He got upon the firestep, placed his rifle against
the wall, and tied his waterproof across his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Old Flanagan is back,&quot; said Bubb, as Bowdy
made his way towards the dug-out. &quot;&#39;E &#39;as come
wiv a fresh draft o&#39; men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? Flanagan? Where is he?&quot; Bowdy
asked in one mouthful.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
&quot;He&#39;s in the dug-out,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy rushed in, almost trampling on the face
of a man who was asleep near the door. Yes,
Flanagan was there&mdash;handsome Flanagan, the
gallant youngster with a college education.</p>

<p class="indent">He was an Irish boy and belonged to the section
at St. Alban&#39;s in the old days. He was a fine-looking
youth of medium height, with heavy dark
hair, an intelligent forehead, impassioned nostrils
and an air of aloofness which became him
well. He had a frank and open expression, pensive
grey eyes and high cheekbones. He came
from the West of Ireland and had studied for
the priesthood. But feeling that this was not his
vocation he entered the Civil Service. His people
belonged to an old Irish family full of pride
and poverty. Flanagan, though well educated,
was a bit of a rake and loved the bottle. When
excited he spoke with a delicious brogue and
paid little heed to his grammar, but he was an
omnivorous reader and carried a number of
books about with him in his haversack. Montaigne
was a great favourite of his. He had
gone home badly wounded seven months earlier
and his mates never expected to see him out in
France again.</p>

<p class="indent">He was now sitting in a corner of the dug-out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
his handsome face radiant with joy and eagerness,
betraying a certain boyish innocence which
in no way detracted from the dignity of his features.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve come back again, Flan?&quot; Bowdy said,
and gripped him by the hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&#39;m back again,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad to be with us?&quot; Bowdy queried. &quot;Glad
to leave London and come out here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I am,&quot; he answered, handing Benners
a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">The confession staggered Benners, but in a
way he was not surprised. Flanagan was a
youngster who took eagerly to the life of war, its
romance and roving. He wanted to attempt
everything; nothing was too big for him. With
him it was no sooner see than try, and his store of
enthusiasm was so unbounded that he generally
succeeded in most projects. But to come back
again when his wound must surely have been a
permanent Blighty one!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why have you come back?&quot; Bowdy asked.
&quot;Tell me all about it while I rouse the brazier
and make a mess-tin of tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mess-tin of tea!&quot; he exclaimed, as Bowdy
bent over the brazier. &quot;God, it&#39;s good to hear
that, old man! The cups are so small at home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Little things. But a mess-tin full! Heavens,
things are done on such a big scale in the trenches!
One gets long hours of fighting, of working, of
watching. Everything is taken in big mouthfuls
here; there&#39;s nothing petty in the job. But at
home&mdash;the soft beds&mdash;but I could not sleep; the
little tea-cups&mdash;but I had no appetite; the politeness,
the swank, the fine dresses&mdash;but the
whole thing made me ill. We&#39;ve been looking on
the gods here, and I went back to live with ordinary
mortals&mdash;I couldn&#39;t stick it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a big fool, Flan,&quot; said Benners, as he
fanned the brazier with a week-old copy of an
English paper. &quot;I would like to get home. I&#39;d
be in no hurry....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think so,&quot; said Flanagan, &quot;but you&#39;d
soon change your mind. I spent two months in
hospital, then I was sent to a convalescent camp.
But my shoulder wouldn&#39;t mend; you know I got
it in the shoulder. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm; something
was dislocated. But that didn&#39;t matter....
The convalescent camp was a damned nice
place, near Brighton and beside the sea. There
was an old sergeant-major, a rheumaticky old
fellow who talked through his nose. But a good
fellow all the same. We called him Nick Nock.
He had no end of trouble with us, the Old Sweats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
and he was always on the look-out for me. Got
my name into his head somehow, and maybe I
was not easy-going enough for a rheumaticky old
man. He must have been about sixty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We slept in huts. Nick Nock would come to
the door of our hut in the early morning. &#39;Are
yer all in bed yet?&#39; he would shout. (Flanagan
gave an imitation of a man speaking through his
nose). &#39;Are yer never goin&#39; to get up? Where&#39;s
Flanagan?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Close the door, Nick Nock,&#39; someone would
say. &#39;It&#39;s too blurry cold. Close the door, will
yer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll not close the door,&#39; the old man would
answer. &#39;I&#39;ll get every man of you out o&#39; bed
&#39;fore I leave &#39;ere. They&#39;re up in all the huts bar
this&#39;n.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh! Close the door,&#39; one would say, rising
up in bed and lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll not close the door,&#39; the sergeant would
answer. &#39;Wot I want to know is this: where&#39;s
Flanagan?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Dead,&#39; one would say. &#39;Gassed in the knees.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&#39;E&#39;s &#39;angin&#39; on the wires,&#39; from another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&#39;Is bed wasn&#39;t slept on last night,&#39; from Nick
Nock. &#39;When I see &#39;im, &#39;e&#39;ll be for it. And
you&#39;ll all be for it if ye&#39;re not out o&#39; kip when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
come back &#39;ere in ten minutes from now. Mind
that.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Close the door, Nick Nock,&#39; the hut would
shout, as the sergeant turned to go out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll not shut the door.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Leavin&#39; it like that and it so cold,&#39; all would
expostulate. &#39;Please shut the door.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll not shut the door,&#39; from Nick Nock.
&#39;One would fink that the whole damn caboosh is
out on a Sunday School treat.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the old man would go out, closing the
door behind him. Time for me to appear then.
I would come out from under the table where I
had hidden. I had been out all night and just
got into the hut before Nick Nock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was Nick Nock ever out here?&quot; asked Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sixty-five and rheumaticky, what could he
do?&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;But he felt it. Once he
said to us, &#39;You know, boys, I feel out o&#39; place
&#39;ere. You fellows &#39;ave been out an&#39; fightin&#39;, and
&#39;ere when you come &#39;ome, I&#39;m bossin&#39; ye. It&#39;s
not fair.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! but another time he gave us a lecture,
and this was how he began:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Boys, there &#39;as been great changes in the
harmy of late years. When I joined, it twasn&#39;t as
good as it is now, but after I came things improved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
and at the present day a man cannot do
better than roll up an&#39; become a soldier.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damn Nick Nock,&quot; said Bowdy Benners.
&quot;Tell me something about yourself. What did
you do after you left the convalescent camp?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I went off on leave from the convalescent
camp, lost my pass, and forgot when I had
to return. I came back seven days late. Things
took a turn; Nick Nock reported me and I was
taken before a medical board. The board had to
determine whether I was in a fit state to survive
seven days in jankers or not. Three or four old
and wise men pummelled me, sounded me, and
did a lot of other things. Finally they discharged
me from the army. God! I could jump over the
moon with joy. I bought a suit of civvies, brown
tweeds, patent leather boots, and a nice white collar,
a dainty little tie, a velours hat. I was quite
a swell. Some of my friends live in London and
I stopped with them. They were going to help
me, get me a bomb-proof job with good pay and
lazy hours. I had been a bit of a rake before the
war, but they did not mind that. A boy must
have his fling. I had proved myself a man when
the country called. You know the things they
would say, stock phrases that are worthy of an
auctioneer. I liked it for a little, Bowdy; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
then, the small teacups, the small talk, the little
tit-bits of scandal....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan got to his feet, stuck his hands in his
pockets, and looked at Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to lie awake at night&mdash;the beds were
so damned soft and uncomfortable&mdash;and think
of the nights spent out in the trenches, sitting in
a snug dug-out with the rain pattering on the
roof, or through it,&quot; Flanagan went on, fixing his
gaze at the candle. &quot;Again my thoughts would
run on the long night marches up the road, with
the moonlight on the cobbles, and the big poplars
standing upright like pompous sergeant-majors,
away up to the star-shells, the big guns and the
trenches. I thought of these things night after
night, and I began to feel afraid. I knew that it
was coming, I knew that I would leave England
and come out to France again. I felt stifled at
home; everything was so small and little. God,
the tea is beginning to bubble already!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember, old man, that night when
we lay in the orchard, waiting to go up to the
trenches to attack?&quot; he suddenly asked, thrusting
his face almost into Bowdy&#39;s. &quot;Do you mind the
buses, crowded with soldiers carrying rifles at all
angles, going by on the road, the star-shells flaring
up in the sky, and the bayonets glittering?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
The buses&mdash;going, going like hell, and the stars
above shining through the apple trees&mdash;the trees
were in blossom then, if you mind.... Don&#39;t
you remember it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall never forget it,&quot; Bowdy answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the raids?&quot; he questioned, in a slow
voice. &quot;Crawling out through the long grasses
with the poppies flicking you in the face, your
nerves tense, not knowing what the next moment
would bring. I thought of these things day after
day, and in the end I succumbed to the old lure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twas a difficult job getting back again.
There was I, dismissed from the army, and no
more good as a fighter; my shoulder stiff and
sore; my discharge papers showing that I was
medically unfit, and in fact a thorough wash-out.
But something had to be done. &#39;Twas then that
I met old Nick Nock again. He was discharged,
too&mdash;time-expired. I met him, I grieve to state,
in a pub. I stood him a drink and told him my
predicament. He thought for a moment, then
he said: &#39;Why not come back from the back o&#39;
beyond, a sailor, go up to the recruiting station
an&#39; call yerself Bill Jackson an&#39; get taken on
again. Don&#39;t mention a word about yer shoulder,
an&#39; maybe the M.O. won&#39;t notice it. Gawd! I&#39;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
go wiv yer meself, Flanagan, if it wasn&#39;t fer
those damned rheumatics.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tried the dodge, got taken on as Bill Jackson,
who was at one time A.B. before the mast,
and now Flanagan is dead to the British Army
henceforward, evermore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The tea is about ready, Bill Jackson,&quot; Bowdy
said, as his mate sat down on the floor between
the legs of a man who was sound asleep and
breathing heavily. &quot;If you care to wait a little,
I&#39;ll fry a rasher of bacon. Rations are pretty
plump to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is there any rum going?&quot; Flanagan
asked, springing to his feet again. He was too
excited to remain still. &quot;How strange that I
had forgotten to ask about the rum rations until
now,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I suppose there&#39;ll be a tot
after a little?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s within the bounds of possibility,&quot; Bowdy
remarked, as he put two rashers of bacon in the
mess-tin lid and placed the lid on the brazier.
&quot;But we&#39;ll see to that later. Necessities before
luxuries out here, Bill Jackson,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">The bacon was ready and they sat down, Flanagan
and Bowdy, and commenced to eat. Meals
have no season in the trenches, but they are always
welcome.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
&quot;God, it&#39;s good to be back here!&quot; said Flanagan.
&quot;I&#39;ve never been so happy in all my life!
I hope the war won&#39;t end until this happiness is
worn out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was sincere in his expressions, and his mood
almost became Bowdy&#39;s before the meal was at
an end. They lay back when they had eaten and
lit cigarettes. The smoke wreathed upwards to
the roof, where the mice was scurrying amidst
the rafters under the sandbags. The soldiers
were still asleep on the floor, their bodies curled
up in queer attitudes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They sleep sound,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;Who
is that snoring? Is it old Snogger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Snogger it is,&quot; said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;I knew his
snore. I couldn&#39;t sleep like that at home&mdash;I&#39;m
very glad to be out here again. It&#39;s a great life,
and I like it more than ever before. I suppose
I&#39;ll get tired of it again, after a while. The novelty
will wear out in due time, I&#39;ve no doubt.
By the way, have you Fitzgerald with you yet?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s here,&quot; Bowdy made answer. &quot;He&#39;s in
love with a French girl named Fifi. He&#39;s very
fond of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s in love, is he?&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;I mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
him at St. Albans; he was in love so often. But
none would take him seriously,&quot; he said. &quot;Why,
I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb, the sentry, came to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oo&#39;s next on?&quot; he yelled. &quot;Sleepin&#39; there
like &#39;ogs, you is. Get up out&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave him alone,&quot; said Flanagan, alluding
to the soldier whom Bubb was endeavouring to
rouse up. &quot;I&#39;ll do his turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, blimey, that&#39;s a strange caper,&quot; said
Bubb, as Flanagan disappeared through the door.
&quot;One would fink &#39;e was in love wiv this &#39;ere caboosh.
I know o&#39; one squadder that ain&#39;t, that&#39;s
this &#39;ere kid. Well, any&#39;ow, I&#39;m goin&#39; to &#39;ave a
kip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb and Bowdy lay down together and
dropped off to sleep, listening to the patter of the
rain on the roof, while outside on the firestep
Flanagan was standing on guard, humming an
old Irish song, his heart filled with the joy of a
wanderer who has returned to his kind.</p>

<p class="indent">The Irish were back in the trenches again.
It was night; the ground was covered
with snow, and Spudhole who did not
feel well was glad of an hour&#39;s rest in a dug-out.</p>

<p class="indent">The dug-out belonged at one time to the Germans.
It was a spacious apartment stretching
out into unfathomable corners. The dry floor
was level as a board and all round the walls snug
little crannies were scraped out in the clay. Here
were stored all manner of odds and ends, bully
beef tins, loaves, biscuits, coils of barbed wire,
hand grenades, bandoliers, water jars, tins of
jam, candles and firewood.</p>

<p class="indent">A brazier burned on the floor, the smoke curled
upwards and was sucked out through a hole in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
the roof as through a chimney. A dozen men
sat around the fire, their sheepskin jackets steaming
and the brass buckles of their equipment shining
like gold. The blaze, burning high, lit up
the steady eyes and ruddied the strong features
of the men. Spudhole, half asleep, leant forward
over his knees, his arms folded, his shoulders
humped up and his helmet well down over his
face. Bowdy Benners was writing a letter, his
notepaper spread out on Bubb&#39;s back, his knees
crossed. An old, wrinkled man of forty-eight,
named Bill Hurd, was telling how his own son
had joined the Army at the outbreak of war.
Hurd was an Irishman and had worked as a carpenter
on a big estate in Devon, and his son John
had a job in his father&#39;s workshop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twas two days after war was declared,&quot;
Bill was saying, &quot;and I was down in the kitchen
waitin&#39; till it was time to go out till my job. I
was always an early riser. Upstairs I heard John
singin&#39; like a thrush. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with him?&#39;
I says till myself, for, though he was a good, willin&#39;
cub, he was not an early riser. When he
came down I says till him, &#39;What&#39;s up wid ye
this mornin&#39;?&#39; I says. &#39;I&#39;m goin&#39; till jine up,&#39; he
says. It most took my breath away. &#39;But ye&#39;re
not only eighteen come the end of next week,&#39; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
says till him. &#39;But I can be nineteen at a pinch,&#39;
he answers, and what was to be said to that? I
ups and shakes him by the hand. &#39;Ye&#39;re a man,
that&#39;s what ye are,&#39; I says till him. &#39;And where
are ye goin&#39; to jine up?&#39; I asks him. &#39;In the town,&#39;
he says, meanin&#39; the town nearest where there
was a recruitin&#39; station. &#39;Then I&#39;ll go &#39;long wid
ye an&#39; see that ye&#39;re right fitted up,&#39; I says to him.
&#39;I must go out an&#39; do an hour&#39;s work,&#39; he then
says. &#39;When I&#39;ve finished that I&#39;ll be ready to
go.&#39; &#39;Right, me boy,&#39; I says, for I knew that he
wanted to go out and tell the other men what he
was going to do.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So we goes to the recruitin&#39; station and the
corp&#39;ral there runs a tape over John. &#39;Ye&#39;ll do,&#39;
he says. &#39;Ye&#39;ll make a fine sodger.&#39; So we went
out, me an&#39; him, and I goes wid him to the nearest
tobacco shop. &#39;Now think of what ye&#39;re goin&#39;
to do,&#39; I says till him. &#39;It&#39;s not an easy job,
the job of a sodger. Now think,&#39; I said, &#39;think,
me boy.&#39; He looked at me straight in the face
and said, as if he was offended: &#39;Ye don&#39;t think
I&#39;ve done wrong, do ye?&#39; Begorra, there and
then, I just&mdash;and there were a lot iv people lookin&#39;
at us&mdash;I just caught him be the hand and
squeezed it. &#39;Ye&#39;re a man,&#39; I says, &#39;an&#39; I&#39;ll get
ye a pipe an&#39; tobacco.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
&quot;And so I did, and would ye misdoubt me when
I say that he was as handy puttin&#39; a match to
a pipe as I was meself. But it&#39;s not easy to understand
young cubs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When did you join up?&quot; asked Snogger, who
came into the dug-out at that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long after that,&quot; said Billy. &quot;There was a
young fellow on the estate, the son of me mistress.
A fine, hearty-lookin&#39; fellow, a rale good
lump iv a cub with laughey eyes and so handsome.
He was a great friend iv mine. Well, he
was an officer in the regulars, and he got hit in
the eyes out here be a splinter iv a shell and he
was knocked stone blind. He comes home, goes
into hospital, and was there for long enough, but
nothin&#39; could be done. All hope was lost; he
would be blind for life. And his mother, she took
it as calm as anything. &#39;Billy,&#39; she used to say
to me, &#39;somebody must suffer and it&#39;s all for the
country when all&#39;s said and done.&#39; She was a
brave woman; didn&#39;t wear her heart on her
sleeve. I never saw her eyes wet, not until one
day. &#39;Twas when her boy sent a wee fretwork
letter-rack home from hospital as a present to
his mother. He had made it himself, blind as
he was, and it was very purty. I was doin&#39; a
bit of woodwork in the hall when it came in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
parcel. The mother opened the parcel and saw
what was inside.... And she began to cry as
if she would never stop. After that, when anybody
spoke of her boy, she would burst out
weepin&#39;.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I liked the boy,&quot; said Billy. &quot;So I
thought &#39;twas up to me to have revinge for him
on the Germans. So I had a clean shave and
went to the recruitin&#39; office and signed on as a
man of thirty-nine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye should have had more sense,&quot; said Bubb,
getting to his feet, and disappearing into a corner.
No doubt the boy, who was not feeling well,
wanted to snatch an hour&#39;s sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Snogger looked at the men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Six of you for rashun fatigue,&quot; he said.
&quot;Two to relieve the men on guard. Whose turn
is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m one,&quot; said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me as well,&quot; said Billy Hurd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull yourselves together, then, and git out,&quot;
said Snogger. &quot;It&#39;s two minutes past time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy and Billy got to their feet, buckled their
equipment and went out to their posts. An hour
later they came back. Bowdy shook the snow
from his sheepskin jacket and sat down on the
ground beside the brazier.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s a very cold night outside,&quot; he said.
&quot;Freeze the horns off a brass monkey, it would.
Where&#39;s Spudhole?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot&#39;s wrong now? Wot d&#39;yer want?&quot; asked
a feeble voice, as Spudhole peeped out from a
dark corner by the wall. He rose to his feet and
buttoned his sheepskin jacket which had become
loose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you feeling now, Spudhole?&quot; asked
Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m all right; in the pink,&quot; said Spud.
&quot;&#39;Ave yer a drop of water to spare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy handed a water-bottle to Spud; the
youngster raised it to his lips and drank greedily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cold water&#39;s not a drink for a night like this,&quot;
said Bowdy. &quot;What you want is something hot.
If I make a mess-tin of tea, will you have some?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Bubb, handing the bottle
back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; to &#39;ave another kip now,&quot; he added.
&quot;Rouse me up when it&#39;s my turn for sentry-go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lay back, closed his eyes and felt very cold.
At intervals he shivered, shaking from head to
foot. Innumerable currents of icy air seemed to
have taken up their abode in the dug-out, living,
crafty currents as cruel as enemies, which stole
slyly down his back penetrating between flesh and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
underclothing. They blew on the back of his
neck; when he turned round he encountered them
on his face, they stole out from all corners incessantly
chilling him with their treacherous,
frozen breath. He fell asleep, woke up, and it
seemed to him that a swarm of ants had got into
his throat and that other ants, thousands of them,
were crawling over his arms and legs.</p>

<p class="indent">He got up, shook himself. His legs felt very
weak, his head was spinning. He tottered over
to the fire. Bowdy, who was pouring a handful
of tea into the boiling water, looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens, Spudhole, you are looking
bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Feeling cold?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cold&#39;s not the word,&quot; Bubb replied. &quot;I
wouldn&#39;t be worse off &#39;andcuffed to a ghost.
Wot&#39;s the time?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten to eleven,&quot; said Bowdy, looking at his
wrist watch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just &#39;bout my time for sentry-go,&quot; said Bubb
in a weak voice. &quot;I s&#39;pose I&#39;m gettin&#39; trench
fever or somefin&#39;,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy placed a spoonful of condensed milk
in the tea, stirred it and added sugar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This will warm you up,&quot; he said, filling the
mess-tin lid with tea and handing it to Bubb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&quot;Then you can lie down agin near the fire and
I&#39;ll do your turn as sentry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole had the lid half raised to his lips.
His hand shook, the tea splashed out in little
drops which fell on the brazier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bowdy!&quot; he said, in a slow voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve never failed at my work yet,&quot; said Spudhole.
&quot;I&#39;m not &#39;ere in the trenches to shift my
jobs on to other blokes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&#39;re feeling queer,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;If
I felt like that I would go down and see the M.O.
and get shoved into hospital.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you!&quot; said Spudhole, placing the mess-tin
lid on the floor. &quot;I know better. Wot did
I &#39;ear yer say once? Ye&#39;d never leave your
trenches when the regiment was there unless you
were carried out on a stretcher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was only swank,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;You
drink your tea, Spudhole, and lie down. I&#39;ll put
a couple of sandbags round you and if you&#39;re not
better in the morning, just run down and see the
M.O.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m damned if I goes away from the
line,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Not until the battalion is wiv
me. That&#39;s settled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
He bent down, raised the mess-tin and drank
the tea. Snogger came to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next on sentry-go?&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m there,&quot; said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s my turn,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No chewin&#39; the fat, or some of ye&#39;ll be damned
unlucky,&quot; said Snogger. &quot;&#39;Ooever&#39;s on&#39;s on,
that&#39;s all; so get some elbow grease on and &#39;urry
out. Them that&#39;s on&#39;s a minute and &#39;arf over
their time already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole went out, crawled up on the firestep
and relieved the sentry. Leaning both arms on
the parapet, he looked over No Man&#39;s Land towards
the German trenches. The levels in front,
a shell-scarred spread of ground set off in its
ghastly array of barbed wire entanglements, was
covered with snow. Here Nature had only one
mood, a mood of sulky menace which overawed
and subdued the tempers of the onlookers. The
sky was coldly clear and a million stars showed
in its broad expanse. But Bubb&#39;s circle of horizon
was very small, objects quite near at hand
stood out weirdly silhouetted with a blurred,
though definite outline. The trenches were
wrapped in ghostly solitude, the brazier aflare
in the dug-out which Bubb had just left added no
relieving tint to the blind helplessness of the night.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
The sick boy stood back from the parapet and
clapped his hands together in an endeavour to
warm himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gawd, it&#39;s cold &#39;ere,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I wish
I was in the dug-out &#39;avin&#39; a kip. &#39;Twould be
so much better than standin&#39; out &#39;ere. But I
wouldn&#39;t &#39;ave it, naw, not at any price. I wouldn&#39;t
shove my job on to any bloke. Bowdy would do
sentry-go for me, good old Bowdy, and so would
old Flan if &#39;e warn&#39;t down at the dump, but why
should they? I wouldn&#39;t mind lettin&#39; them do it
if it was out o&#39; the trenches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you getting on, Spud?&quot; asked a voice
from the trench. &quot;Feeling the cold?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy looked down at Captain Thorley. The
captain and he were great friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cold,&quot; said Spud, through chattering teeth.
&quot;It&#39;s not warm &#39;ere, is it, sir? I feel as cold as
if I was &#39;andcuffed to a ghost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hear that you&#39;re not feeling well,&quot; said the
captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m orlright, sir. Was a bit dicky a minute
back, but the cold air &#39;asn&#39;t &#39;arf bucked me up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you know that Bowdy will do your job
for you if you&#39;re feeling queer,&quot; said Thorley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that, sir, but I&#39;m orlright,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;Besides, I wouldn&#39;t rob a man of &#39;is sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
Bubb finished his hour, but when his next turn
as sentry came round he was unable to perform
his duty. He looked helplessly at his mate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bowdy,&quot; he said, in a low, apologetic voice.
&quot;I&#39;ve no guts for anuvver hour&#39;s sentry-go. I&#39;m
washed out. I will go down to the M.O. not to-morrow
mornin&#39; but now. If I stay &#39;ere any
longer, I&#39;ll &#39;ave to be carried out o&#39;t. But didn&#39;t
I stick it to the last, Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, you did. I&#39;m damned if I&#39;d stick
it so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clear out of it at once, Spudhole,&quot; said Billy
Hurd. &quot;Ye&#39;re like a ghost, somethin&#39; like what
a cat would take in on a wet day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye think I&#39;m sick enough to leave &#39;ere then?&quot;
asked Bubb. &quot;I don&#39;t want any o&#39; the fellers to
say, arter I go, that I was swingin&#39; the lead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If ye stop &#39;ere any longer, they&#39;ll say that ye&#39;re
stayin&#39; here, hopin&#39; that ye&#39;ll be so bad when ye
leave that ye&#39;ll never be sent back again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;m off out&#39;t,&quot; said Bubb, decision in
his voice. &quot;I&#39;ll try and be back as soon as I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went outside and made his way to the dressing
station. Dawn found him snug in a motor
ambulance on his way to hospital.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="indent">It was past eight o&#39;clock of a January evening
and the soldiers in &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;
dug-out sat down late to tea. The dug-out
was situated at the bottom of a chalk-pit near
Vimy Ridge and was occupied by officers&#39; servants,
company runners, signallers and others
who generally kept in close touch with battalion
headquarters. The chalk pit was more or less
immune from shell fire, for, being narrow and
deep, it was difficult for a shell to reach the bottom,
round which a ring of spacious dug-outs
circled. Over the top and five hundred yards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
eastwards ran the communication trench which
wound its way discreetly up to the British front
line.</p>

<p class="indent">Lights gleamed in the dug-outs and sounds of
laughter and singing could be heard from &quot;Home
Sweet Home.&quot; It was a capacious shelter, originally
fashioned by the French, and capable of
holding thirty men. At the present moment it
contained some fifteen British soldiers engaged
in the pleasant task of eating a substantial meal.
Rations as well as the post had just come up from
the railhead, rum was issued, and the parcels from
home had been bulky. The meal was proceeding
merrily. Some of the men were laughing and
chatting, sitting on the ground, their knees
crossed and mess-tins of steaming tea in their
hands. Two or three were stripped and their wet
clothes were hung over the fire in the brazier.
All were so cool and happy that it was difficult
to believe that the German shells were just dropping
outside the door.... Suddenly the waterproof
sheet that covered the door was raised and
a newcomer entered. He stood for a moment
looking round, then he approached an up-ended
ammunition box which stood in the centre of the
dug-out and sat down on it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s old Fitzgerald,&quot; exclaimed Flanagan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
now of the signalling section, who was endeavouring,
with the aid of a bayonet, to draw
the cork from a rum jar. &quot;How are things going
on up at Vimy?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so bad,&quot; Fitzgerald answered. &quot;There&#39;s
plenty of shells flying across, and now and again
we get a Minnie, saucy devil. We do get more
than is good for our health. Vimy is not the
most pleasant place on our front. I&#39;ve helped
to take a prisoner down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A prisoner?&quot; Flanagan exclaimed, handing
Fitzgerald a drop of rum in a mess-tin. &quot;A German?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a youngster,&quot; Fitzgerald answered, lifting
the rum reverently to his lips and rolling it
round in his mouth. &quot;He was caught on a listening
patrol. Wounded and unconscious. I&#39;ve
got to wait here until he recovers, hear what he
has to say, and report back to Captain Thorley
with any information. You know we fear a mine
going up at the sap, for all day and night we can
hear tapping under the ground.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald held out his mess-tin again and received
another tot of rum. Then he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothing like a drop of rum,&quot; he remarked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s &#39;health to the navel and marrow
to the bones,&#39; as the Scripture has it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hut laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about a song, Fitz?&quot; Flanagan asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An old Irish one; a come-all-you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nell Flaherty&#39;s Drake?&quot; said Fitz in a tone
of enquiry. The rum had put him in gay good
humour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spit it out,&quot; Flanagan yelled.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald commenced the song.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;My name it is Nell, the truth for to tell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I live near Coothill, which I&#39;ll never deny,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I had a fine drake, the truth for to spake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which my grandmother left me before she did die.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;He was wholesome and sound and could weigh forty pound,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The wide world round I would roam for his sake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But bad luck to the robber be he drunk or sober,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who murdered Nell Flaherty&#39;s beautiful drake.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;May his temples wear horns and all his toes corns,</span><br />
<span class="i0">May he always be fed on lobcourse and fish-oil,</span><br />
<span class="i0">May he ne&#39;er go to bed till the moment he&#39;s dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">May his cow never milk, may his kettle never boil.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the supreme curse, I think,&quot; Fitzgerald
remarked, smiling lazily. &quot;&#39;May his kettle
never boil&#39;! Think of that&mdash;in Ireland, where
the teapot&#39;s as greedy as the grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the end of the song?&quot; a soldier asked
from the corner.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
&quot;Only the first three verses,&quot; Fitzgerald replied.
&quot;There are forty verses in the song, but
I forget the rest. My memory!&quot; he exclaimed,
rising to his feet. &quot;Good God! I forget everything,
my memory is my curse.... Who has
got a cigarette to spare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment an orderly came to the door
and shouted out: &quot;D Company runner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m D Company runner,&quot; Fitzgerald remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Report to headquarters immediately,&quot; said the
orderly. &quot;Also Rifleman Flanagan to report.
Two men must take the message.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m there,&quot; said Fitzgerald, turning to Flanagan
and asking: &quot;Can I have another cigarette
before we go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He got another cigarette, placed it in his cap
and accompanied by Flanagan went out into the
open and across to headquarters dug-out. The
adjutant was inside sitting at a table, a cup of
tea and a box of cigarettes in front of him. He
knew Fitzgerald very well, having met him in
civil life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to go to the Ridge as quickly as
you know how,&quot; said the adjutant, fixing his eyes
on the runner. &quot;The young German has regained
consciousness and he tells us that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
enemy are going to blow up three mines under
our front to-morrow morning at six. The men
must withdraw to the second trench until further
orders. I&#39;ve tried to &#39;phone up, but can get no
answer to my calls. The wire must be broken.
Hand the message over to Captain Thorley or
any other officer whom you may encounter. You
do the same, Flanagan, and both report back here
when you&#39;ve done this....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He handed a sealed envelope to Fitzgerald and
the runner went out into the night, the final words
of the adjutant ringing in his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very important, remember; very important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald clambered up the side of the pit with
difficulty, the chalk was frittering away and the
man had very insecure purchase of his feet.
Flanagan followed keeping a hundred yards to
rear. At headquarters another runner was receiving
a similar message. One would certainly
deliver it safely.</p>

<p class="indent">When Fitzgerald crossed the rim of the chalk
pit he could see the line of battle, the starshells
flaring in the heavens and the lurid flames of
bursting explosives lighting up the darkness. In
front a spinney where the trees were riven and
shattered took on strange shapes, the lifeless
ruined branches stretched outwards, as it were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
in reproach and despair; the fallen trees lay on
the ground like rotting corpses.</p>

<p class="indent">War&#39;s earthquake had rent the whole country.
Dark, sepulchral chasms yawned in the ground
and the whole earth seemed to have been gutted to
its core. A little red-brick cottage was smashed
to smithereens; the machinery of a mill stood
suspended over nothing, and shapeless walls,
jagged and lacerated, quivered in air, ready to
fall at the first gust of wind. Where the pits were
dug in the earth, shapeless heaps of white chalk
were flung up, and beside one of these heaps lay
a battery of field guns jumbled in inextricable
confusion. The rusty steel muzzles of the guns
looked grotesque and distorted; the ruined dug-out
in which the gunners once lived, breathed
tragedy from every broken beam and torn sandbag.
Dead men lay all over the place, shamelessly
exposed in the most unlikely situations.
On the field of war Death is denied its privileged
privacy.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald entered the communication trench
and hurried along, panting as he ran. Two shells
swooped over his head, bursting with a vicious
clatter on the field behind him. Others followed,
pounding at the parapet like drunken gods. He
could hear the splinters hitting the parados with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
dull thud to the accompaniment of a thousand
rifle bullets which tore at the suffering sandbags.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald passed through one trench crossing,
then another. &quot;I&#39;ll do it in five minutes now,&quot;
he said, changing his rifle from one shoulder to
the other. &quot;I hope the mine doesn&#39;t go up before
I get there. Five minutes,&quot; he muttered,
&quot;I&#39;ll be there in five minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Fitzgerald miscalculated. At the end of
five minutes he found himself in a deserted
trench, all alone, and then decided that it was
time to turn back. Probably he had taken the
wrong trench at the last crossing. He went back
for a short distance and came to a junction. Several
trenches crossed at this point, but the locality
seemed new to him. He had not been there
before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m damned,&quot; he said, and then added,
&quot;I&#39;m lost as well.&quot; He realised the danger
of his plight and felt uncomfortable. Stories
were often told over braziers in the dim trench
traverse, and many of these stories spoke of men
who went astray in the trenches and never returned.
Sometimes the lost soldiers found themselves
in the enemy&#39;s lines, and on other occasions
they wandered up to their home parapets to fall a
victim to the rifle of a nervous sentry. Fitzgerald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
had heard many of these stories and he recollected
them now.</p>

<p class="indent">Much fighting had recently taken place on
Vimy Ridge and the English and German
trenches criss-crossed in several localities; in
some places both parties occupied the same
trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald, alone and astray, had no definite
idea of his position; he only knew that he was
lost at the cross-trenches and did not know which
trench led to safety. Perhaps he had passed beyond
the British front. He peered over the top.
The night was quiet, scarcely a rifle spoke, though
many star shells were ablaze in the heavens and
dropping petals of flame to the dark earth....
Right in front of Fitzgerald was a ghastly heap,
jumbled and confused, a heap of dead men. And
round this heap lay other dead things, rejected
from the more composite and bulky distortion of
war. The solitary figures lay&mdash;some face downwards,
arms spread out, others curled up like
sleeping dogs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, where am I?&quot; asked Fitzgerald.
&quot;Whose starshell is that, ours or theirs?... Where&#39;s
our line?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at a dead thing near him and shuddered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Then, shouldering his rifle, he made his
way up the trench on his right.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is all right!&quot; he muttered, passing a
projecting beam of a fallen dug-out. &quot;I passed
this a minute ago ... but not this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He detached himself awkwardly from the heap
of limp bodies into which he had fallen and hurriedly
retraced his steps to the junction where
the dark trenches opened up to unknown mysteries.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald leant wearily against the wall and
puzzled over many things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I go over the top, what happens?&quot; he asked
himself. &quot;Run into a German patrol, maybe,
or into one of our own covering parties and they&#39;ll
shoot me on sight. If I go along a trench, I&#39;ll
probably get into the German lines. That won&#39;t
do, either. I&#39;m like a rat in a trap.... But I
must get out of it. Yes, I must get out of it.... But
how?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question caused a queer sensation to run
down the innermost parts of his body and the
sensation was one of fear. He mumbled many
things to himself in a thick, quick undertone.
Then, without realising the risks he ran, Fitzgerald
crawled over the parapet and went out into
the open, taking his rifle with him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
It was a man lying face downwards on the
ground that attracted his attention first. He
could have sworn that the man moved and
brought a rifle to bear upon him. Fitzgerald
stood upright and fired at the man twice, only
to find that he was riddling a corpse with bullets.
He flung himself flat to avoid the machine gun
that opened fire and waited till it ceased its play.
A galaxy of starshells lit up the heavens and a
big shell of another pattern whirled across the
open and burst with a dizzy clatter. In the distance
could be heard the transports of war clattering
along the roads, the clank of rails unleaded
at some far-off railway siding, and gleaming
luridly against the darkness could be seen
the flames of a building on fire some dozen miles
away. Near Fitzgerald lay a dead man, further
off another, looking like an empty sack flung on
the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The maxim fire stammered into silence and the
youth got to his feet, looked round and listened
with strained ears. Somewhere near he could
hear the sound of hammers and the creaking of
shovels and he concluded that a working party
was busy at its toil. It was impossible to determine
to what side the party belonged. It might
be German. The lines of trenches were very confused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
and salients projected out like ducks&#39; bills
in places, and at other points they receded some
five hundred yards from the opposite front. No
man was ever more solitary than poor, mud-stained
Rifleman Fitzgerald at that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">And the night was full of mysterious whispers,
sounds, creakings and rustlings. Spirits seemed
to lurk on the vacant face of the earth and uncanny
spirits hovered over the world. In the
near distance all objects took on strange, undefined
shapes, well in keeping with the grotesque
fantasy of war.... Suddenly Fitzgerald fancied
that he heard somewhere near him the sharp
snap of a rifle bolt. He turned round and scurried
back to the trench which he had just left. It
seemed quite a distance to traverse and he slipped
over the parapet and flopped down into the mud.
But not a soul was to be seen, the trench was deserted.
Neither was it the trench which he had
left. Here the slush reached his hips. &quot;Well,
I&#39;m damned!&quot; he said, and leant against the parapet.
&quot;What am I going to do? I&#39;m going to
stick here, stick well in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Shadow and silence brooded over the place, he
had descended into the stagnation of the tomb.
The clammy slush ran down his top boots and
settled round his heels. He advanced one step,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
then another, touching both walls of the alley
with his outstretched hands. He looked up and
saw that the walls were very steep. It was impossible
to climb up; the clay was too soft, it
came away in the hands, and his feet were so
weighty. Besides now he was sticking. Every
time he moved the mud gripped him with greater
vehemence. It seemed as if his feet were slipping
down the throat of a voracious monster
which was endeavouring to swallow him. The
floor of the trench was a treacherous quicksand,
as greedy as the grave. For a moment, Fitzgerald
fought madly against the embrace of this
soft, elusive terror, he gripped at the walls, the
mud came away in his hands, he pulled one foot
out, the other sank deeper. To move was
ghastly, to remain still was deadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must move,&quot; he muttered. &quot;If I don&#39;t I&#39;ll
die; if I make a struggle, my fate will rest on the
knees of the gods and they may save me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mud was reaching his waist. To pull out
one leg he had to reach forward until his face
touched the mucky floor, raise his hind foot clear,
bring it round with a circular motion and place
it down in the slush again. The same operation
had to be performed at each remove. Once, he
placed his hands in the muck and tried to crawl.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
But the effort was futile; his hands sunk in to
the shoulder and the earth rose greedily, as if
wanting to clutch him.</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald came to a halt and looked hopelessly
round. Nothing was to be seen but the darkness;
the night was a cavern in which he had got
lost. He gripped at the wall of the trench with
furious fingers and part of the parapet came away
in his hands, almost burying him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s no good. I&#39;m going to peg out here,&quot; he
said, as he tried to shake himself clear. &quot;If I only
had a starshell over my head I&#39;d look for a spot
to die. I would select a better spot than this, anyway,
if I had choice. But they&#39;ve stopped sending
up starshells now.... And I should have
a parcel by the post to-night,&quot; he muttered. &quot;And
another drop of rum will be going round now I
think.... But is that all I&#39;ve to think
about?...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shouted at the top of his voice, but there
was no reply. He yelled again and then became
silent. &quot;What&#39;s the good of it?&quot; he asked himself
in a whisper. &quot;I don&#39;t know where I am.
Maybe I&#39;m near the German trenches. If they
find me here what will they do? Tread me in,
probably.... And the mine, what about it?
I&#39;ve still got the message in my pocket. I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
this had happened after I had delivered the thing.
But I&#39;ll go on a bit. I&#39;ll get to somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He moved forward. The first step was difficult,
the next was easier, the subsoil had lost its
birdlime tenacity and the slush was not as dense.
A few steps further and Fitzgerald breathed.
He was going up an incline, getting out of it his
head was almost parallel with the rim of the
trench. He burst into song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Four stick standers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Four lilly wanders,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A hooker</span><br />

<span class="i0">And a coat of bawnagh brockagh.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The song suddenly stopped. A heavy shell
swept over his head and burst very near. Another
followed and another and Fitzgerald noticed
that he had reached a junction where a number
of trenches criss-crossed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another damned labyrinth,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;Out you get, on to the top, Rifleman Fitzgerald,&quot;
he ordered, apostrophising himself. And out he
did get. It was now he discovered that his rifle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
had vanished, &quot;Oh, I suppose it&#39;s in the mud,&quot;
he muttered. &quot;Lucky I&#39;m not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A trench showed some distance away. He
made for it, slipped over the parapet and landed
on something soft which moved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gawd Orlmighty! Wot the &mdash;&mdash; are yer
&mdash;&mdash; up ter,&quot; said a soldier, rising from the mud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re shelling us,&quot; said Fitzgerald.
&quot;You&#39;d better rouse up. What trench is this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The support,&quot; said the man, &quot;We&#39;re waitin&#39;
for a mine to go up or somefing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rest of the men were standing at their
posts, alert and ready. The enemy had become
nasty and were using an exceptionally heavy
shell on the sector, but as yet it was bursting
wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A nine-point-two,&quot; somebody remarked to
Fitzgerald, adding: &quot;And Gawd! it doesn&#39;t &#39;arf
send the dirt flyin&#39; about. They&#39;ll attack, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any officers near here, Spudhole?&quot; Fitzgerald
asked, for he had recognised the voice of his
comrade Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Orficers,&quot; said Spudhole. &quot;Yes, Cap&#39;n Thorley
was about &#39;ere a minute ago; &#39;e.... Gor
blimey, there&#39;s the shell again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald listened and heard &quot;her&quot; coming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
crooning out the unknown. It was the big shell.
Gathering volume it approached, an inevitable
terror, a messenger of death. There was a hurried
stampede to a near dug-out and Fitzgerald
found himself in the crush and carried forward
into the dark recess of a deep shelter. In the next
few moments he was conscious of many things,
of a sudden fall to the soft, muddy floor, of a
choking sensation in the throat, a monstrously
futile effort to drag himself clear of the man who
fell on top of him, of nervous laughter and fierce
imprecations. Then he sank into forgetfulness.
The shell had blown the dug-out in on its occupants.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not yet dawn, and the rain dropped sullenly
into the wet trench where the soldiers
stood to arms on the banquette, yawning and
shivering with the cold. The bayonets showed
clear cut and ominous when the blazing star-shell
caught them. The men on watch shook themselves,
rubbed their eyes with clay-encrusted fingers,
and hummed monotonous tunes. All was
very quiet. The dawn was oppressive, the dark,
mysterious levels had an ominous threat in their
incomprehensible silence. The support trench
into which the soldiers had come was a great mysterious
alley filled with spectres as impalpable as
air.... The dawn came imperceptibly, men
stood down and spoke of breakfast. But there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
was no fire; the loaves and biscuits were sodden
with rain. Spudhole, who tried to open a tin
of bully-beef with his clasp knife, cut his finger
and swore dreadfully. His mates stared at him
and nodded their heads, but did not speak....</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Thorley came along the trench speaking
to the men on sentry-go.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cut your finger, Spudhole?&quot; he asked when
he came into the bay in which Bowdy and Bubb
were stationed. The captain knew every man by
nickname.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cut it,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Course I&#39;ve cut it, sir.
My fingers are so damn cold. Wot about this &#39;ere
mine, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may go up now at any moment,&quot; said Captain
Thorley. &quot;You&#39;ve all got to keep a good
look-out. When it goes up every man cross the
top and man the crater. Just as you did on
Christmas morning. Bowdy will go with us this
time. On the last occasion he was away, making
love to some dear French girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy blushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pore ole Fitz &#39;as gone west,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;&#39;E&#39;s under the ground wiv a dozen tons o&#39;
muck on top o&#39; &#39;im. There are five or six o&#39; our
boys buried wiv &#39;im. Round the corner in the
next bay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
&quot;I was looking at the dug-out that fell in,&quot;
said Bowdy. &quot;They&#39;re buried deep enough anyhow.
It&#39;s no good digging them out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve no time for that,&quot; said Thorley. &quot;It&#39;s
a long day&#39;s work for a big squad if it&#39;s ever attempted.
Of course there&#39;s not a soul alive.
Fitzgerald was coming with a message too. But
it&#39;s all right, Flanagan brought the message in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see a bay&#39;net stickin&#39; up froo the
roof?&quot; asked Bubb. &quot;The dug-out fell down
round it, and there it&#39;s stickin&#39; up as if it wanted
to stab somebody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment the earth trembled like a wind-shaken
leaf. The men rushed to the parapet and
looked over. Out in front a great lump rose on
the level like a whale breaking up from the sea,
and a livid flash lit the world. The soldiers sank
into cover, mute, pale, hesitating. The roar of
an earthquake filled their ears, and a million flying
fragments filled the sky.... An almost
incoherent order passed along the trench, and on
the right men clambered over the sandbags into
the open field.... They had to take possession
of the mine crater. Snogger, Bowdy Benners
and Bubb were across and in the next minute they
were conscious of many things. Bubb slipped
twice in getting over the top, and panted wearily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
as he rushed towards the spot where the earth
was lumped up black and raw. Other men rushed
along at his side, shouting and yelling. Rifles
were discharged wildly at no particular objective,
and a group of voluble guns chorused in
dizzy harmony.</p>

<p class="indent">The men clambered down the steep sides of the
newly-formed valley, a hundred feet deep or
more, and up the crest again, where it looked
over the enemy&#39;s trenches. The Germans were
already advancing in extended order several hundred
strong. The advance was done at the double
through the lurid flashes of curtain fire which
the English guns had opened. The Germans were
falling, and the sight steadied the men somewhat,
and they trained their rifles with precision and
a certain amount of calmness on the oncomers.</p>

<p class="indent">The English guns were now speaking with
furious vehemence and the shrapnel hissed at the
grey forms which were still rising over the rim
of the trench in front. Bubb and Benners lay
down with their mates on the slope of the parapet
and fired, a bit wildly perhaps, but it was impossible
to miss. A machine-gun, already in
position, swayed its snout from side to side,
snapped viciously, and extracted its toll from the
attackers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
They came forward, rushing wildly, their bayonets
in air, their legs clumsily cutting off the distance
between their trench and the crater. Many
in the first line of attackers were falling and
several were crawling back to their own lines
on their bellies. Our bombers stood waiting,
fingering their bombs nervously. The stench of
explosives was suffocating. Several who were
overcome with the gases dropped to the ground
and rolled down the slope into the bottom of the
pit. Bill Hurd stood up on the verge of the
crater, where the wet, glistening machine-gun
peeped forth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steady, boys, steady!&quot; he cried. &quot;Take careful
aim! Don&#39;t waste a round! Make every
bullet tell! We&#39;ll beat them off! We&#39;ll beat
them back, back, well back! Begorrah we&#39;ll show
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked enormous, standing there, shouting
vehemently and waving his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beat them back!&quot; he yelled, repeating the
same remark over and over again. His rifle lay
against the rim of the crater; the bayonet, rusty
and grim, peered over the top as if in waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take good aim,&quot; he shouted, running along
the rim of the crater. &quot;Be sure of your min....
Don&#39;t get flurried.... We&#39;ll bate thim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
back easily!... Keep cool and don&#39;t get flurried.
If ye do you&#39;ll be damned unlucky. Don&#39;t
get excited,&quot; he shouted. &quot;If you do it won&#39;t be
no good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held his peace then and Bubb looked round
to see where he had sought cover. He was lying
on his face and a very tiny red scar showed on
his forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the enemy advanced at the double,
the time dragged slowly for the men on the parapet.
They waited in agonised suspense for
closer combat; somehow the firing seemed to have
very little effect on the attackers. Hundreds
fell and hundreds took the place of the fallen.
The rim of the foemen&#39;s parapet was like the
lip of a waterfall; the men came across in waves,
got dashed to pieces, and waves followed only
to meet with a similar fate. The successive
lines of men were endless, eternal as a running
brook.</p>

<p class="indent">The German first line drew nearer, the English
could almost see the expressions of the men&#39;s
faces; felt that the soul of the attackers was not
in their work. It was impossible to miss them
now. The attacking lines withered like waves
on a beach. One man who came in front flung
down his rifle, raced towards the crater with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
hands in air and jumped in on top of Bill Hurd&#39;s
bayonet, a ludicrous fixture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull it out!&quot; he yelled in agony, speaking
in good English. &quot;Pull it out, for Gott&#39;s
sake!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But there was no time to spare at that moment;
the English were fighting to save their own skins.
The German rolled down to the bottom of the
crater with the bayonet on which he had sat still
stuck in his body.</p>

<p class="indent">A second and a third wave of attack followed;
but the concentrated fire of the defenders cut
great gaps in the attackers&#39; lines, which became
merged one with the other, when half way across.
The men had no heart for further movement;
they drew themselves to earth, and dug holes in
the ground for safety. The English artillery
fire prevented them from going back, the rifles
would not allow them to come forward; they were
caught between two fires.</p>

<p class="indent">Now and again an entrenching tool could be
seen rising in air, and it was fired at. When a
figure in grey moved, a questing bullet reminded
it forcibly of the indiscretion. At times one
would rise and walk around in an unconcerned
and indifferent manner, probably he had gone
insane, or perhaps the pain of a wound put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
death out of reckoning. The end was in all cases
the same, the bullet found the man, and the
ghastly fury of destruction held its sway.</p>

<p class="indent">On the right they reached the wires and the
boys went out and met them: there the bayonet
was at work.</p>

<p class="indent">They came up in big droves and some fumbled
through. The defenders rushed out and gave
fight.... An excited machine gunner played
for a minute on the crush of friend and foe....</p>

<p class="indent">The Germans lost heart, retreated and were
followed with bayonet, bludgeon and bomb.
Tripping on the wires and stepping in flesh and
blood, they went back, tramping on dead and
wounded. The latter groaned piteously and
shrieked for mercy.</p>

<p class="indent">The retreat became general, the front wave of
attackers receded, those which followed stood
still undecided. Here and there isolated parties
made great fight, holding out until the last men
fell....</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the Irish followed them across: a large
party of prisoners were surrounded near the hostile
trench. The German gunners had shortened
their range and were now shelling the ground between
the lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Fighting was even more severe on the right.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
There a confused and struggling mass reeled
round the wires in a last wild effort, and the German
artillery dealt death impartially to friend
and foe alike. On all sides the wounded
covered the field, lying in huddled heaps, in
rows, singly and in pairs. In front of the mine
a German moved on his stomach, then rose to
his feet and flung a bomb at a party which went
out to succour the wounded. A youngster, a boy
newly out, named Ryan, rushed forward with his
rifle, fired and missed. Still advancing, he slid
a round into the breach of his weapon, shoved
the rifle close to the German&#39;s forehead and
pulled the trigger. The upper part of the man&#39;s
head was blown off....</p>

<p class="indent">All day long the men stopped in the crater,
always on the alert, and in front of them a long
line of earth gradually took shape on the field,
which showed that the enemy worked hard digging
himself in. Towards dusk the dark line
took on a whitish colour; the diggers had reached
the chalk and were well under cover. When
darkness fell the trench was raided and the occupants
taken prisoners. Then graves were dug
and the dead were buried.</p>

<p class="indent">The winter was over, the birds were singing
again on the barbed wire entanglements,
the green grasses peeped out between
the cobbles of the deserted village streets,
and the flowers showed in the open spaces between
the lines. The trenches were becoming
dry; the parapets no longer crumbled down; it
was possible to climb over the parados at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
without flinging half the structure into the muddy
alleys, where the soldiers kept eternal watch on
the lines across the way. Sheepskin jackets were
handed in; top boots were worn no more; a man
could sleep at ease in a dug-out now, for the
roofs, no longer weighted by the rain, had ceased
falling in on the hapless sleepers. The tottering
walls gathered strength; tottering spirits were
braced up; men saw the sun and were pleased.
The winter was over.</p>

<p class="indent">For one who has not experienced them, it is
difficult to realise the hardships of the front line
between the months of October and April. The
trenches are deep ditches filled with mud and
water that reach the waist. Now and again the
heavy top-boots are useless protection against
wet, the water rises over the tops of the boots
and runs down the legs of the men. The boots
stick in the mud, and often the men have to
climb out of them; clamber from cells into a
quagmire. In the days following the first trench
winter when the earth got dry soldiers who had
died in their top-boots were dug from the floors
of the trenches. Weary with their efforts to get
free from the deadly embrace of the muddy quagmire,
they fell asleep and succumbed to exposure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
died in their graves. And in spring they were
dug out and buried anew.</p>

<p class="indent">The dug-out is as treacherous as the trench.
The shaky construction, the lodge of fear, is always
built in a hurry. Weak props hold a crazy
roof in place; sandbags filled with earth serve
the purpose of tiles. In dry weather a dug-out
serves its purpose well, but in the rainy weather
the sandbags becoming saturated finally weigh
the rafters and props down to earth. Time and
again the weary sleepers never wake, their shelter
becomes their grave.</p>

<p class="indent">The trenches in the summer nights have a
charm peculiarly their own when the starshells
riot in the heavens and the air is full of the languorous
scent of sleeping flowers. If the guns of
war are silent, there is a genial atmosphere pervading
the whole place, and men go about their
work in a light-hearted manner.</p>

<p class="indent">One can smell tea brewing in the sheltered
bay where a brazier glows cosily in the lee of
the traverse. A game of cards is in progress in
a dug-out, and a youth may be seen writing a
letter by the light of a timid candle stuck on the
wall. At that moment one does not feel far removed
from home. But what a contrast in the
cheerless winter. All the cosy comfort is a thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
of the past. Men plough through muck and
mire, dragging their feet and legs through water
and mud, or sleep in the open, shivering with
cold. The fingers are chilled to the bone, all
feeling has gone away from the feet; for all one
knows, the feet may have gone. No fires are lit,
there is no wood, nothing that will burn.</p>

<p class="indent">The long night marches have lost all their
romance. Clothes are seldom dry, they cling to
the body like the rags of a drowned man, scourging
and scaling the flesh. The cold rain stings
the flesh, the snow freezes the fingers. Marching
is difficult, the roads are thick with mud, and all
roads lead to the firing line, the line of red agony,
of desolation. The soldier is a mute, impotent
figure, a blind pawn in the game of war. The
billets are cold and cheerless. The broken roof,
which allowed the winds of night to play round
the sleepers in the hot summer weather, now lets
in the cold and wet. Sleep is hardly a rest, it
is a moment of forgetfulness similar to the solace
which a sick man finds in a drug.</p>

<p class="indent">Spring was well on its way now; the boys in
the trenches were happy again. Bubb and
Flanagan were up to any sort of mischief or deed
of daring. The persistent sniper who kept potting
at their bay annoyed them however. Bubb,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
back from hospital and full of vitality, vowed
that it was up to him to put the sniper out of
action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; up on this &#39;ere caboosh at the rear,&quot;
said Bubb pointing to the slag-heap behind the
British front line. &quot;I&#39;ll maybe get a sight on the
Boche.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m with you in the game,&quot; said Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">Both men went out in the early dawn and took
their places close to the crest of the mammoth
slag-heap. Noon found them still there lying
prone on the surface of the coal-mines&#39; off-scour,
their heads close to the rim of the heap, their eyes
fixed on the enemy&#39;s trench which wound slyly
as a snake through the levels some seven hundred
yards away. A spit down from the two boys lay
the English line. Out in front of it dozens of
bundles in khaki lay limp and lifeless, waiting
for the summer to cover them up with her
flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a &#39;undred or more, out there,&quot; said
Bubb. &quot;Gawd, it&#39;s a funny bisness, killin&#39; and
killin&#39;. One would think we enjoys it by the fuss
the pypers in England makes o&#39; it. Anyway,
it&#39;s a blurry rotten way of fightin&#39;,&quot; he continued
as he changed his position by the fraction
of an inch without removing his eye from the tip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
of the rifle foresight. &quot;Gawd,&quot; he whispered,
&quot;I &#39;ave &#39;im now. I saw somefin&#39; move just like
a bird. I&#39;ll give &#39;im a round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; muttered Flanagan, under his breath.
&quot;It&#39;s no good firing if you&#39;re not sure of your
man. One shot will give us away, and that&#39;s the
twentieth time you&#39;ve seen him; each time in a
different spot. He&#39;s not like a bird; he can&#39;t be
in two places at one time.... What the hell!
Don&#39;t move!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A cramp in my guts!&quot; groaned Bubb, wriggling
a little. &quot;Gawd, it isn&#39;t &#39;arf giving me gyp!
Ooh&mdash;whooh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The youth kicked out with both legs, raised
his head an inch or two, then brought it down
again to the level of the earth. Flanagan swore
under his breath and cursed Bubb with vehemence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t &#39;elp it,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;I must move.
I&#39;d rather &#39;ave a bullet in the &#39;ead than a cramp
in my belly. Wooh! It&#39;ll twist me up like a
&#39;edge &#39;og!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matey,&quot; whispered Flanagan, turning half
left and fixing his eyes on Spudhole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that if you&#39;re seen moving you&#39;ll
get a bullet across here&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
&quot;I don&#39;t care a damn,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I do,&quot; muttered Flanagan. &quot;Next time
I come out sniping I&#39;m going to take a man with
me; one that won&#39;t give a position away when he
has got a sore tummy&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to move no more,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;I&#39;m going to be as quiet as a sandbag. Ooh-wooh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&#39;s your cramp now?&quot; asked Flanagan,
when Bubb had kept quiet for a good ten minutes.
&quot;Gone, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s &#39;opped it,&quot; said Spudhole with a laugh.
&quot;Blimey!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both men cowered to earth giggling nervously
as the bomb burst, scattering a cloud of dust over
them. A second shell burst, and a third.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must have spotted us,&quot; said Flanagan,
frowning at the fields.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If they have it&#39;s all up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the shelling ceased as suddenly as it
had begun, and the youngsters breathed freely
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cleaning out their guns, I suppose,&quot; said
Flanagan. &quot;Lucky they didn&#39;t clean us out
of existence.... I&#39;m tired of waiting
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m tired an&#39; &#39;ungry an&#39; &#39;ot,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
we can&#39;t get out of this damned place till
night ... they won&#39;t &#39;arf &#39;ave the laugh on
us when we go back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not half,&quot; said Flanagan absently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I bet Captain Thorley a bob I&#39;d lay
the sniper by the &#39;eels,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;But it&#39;s
no go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, where can the fellow be?&quot; asked
Flanagan, removing a speck of dust from the
backsight of his rifle with a cautious hand. &quot;No
man can fire at us from the German trench. It&#39;s
behind a rise, and even if one of the Boches looks
over the parapet he can&#39;t see our trench. But
still the fact remains that no sooner does one of
our boys look over than a bullet zipps past his
ear. Where does the bullet come from? The
sniper <i>must</i> be between the lines. He must, but
where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole shrugged his shoulders helplessly
and muttered: &quot;We was fools comin&#39; out &#39;ere.
But &#39;e &#39;as done for four of our fellers an&#39; &#39;e
must die. If &#39;e doesn&#39;t....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook a cautious little head and became
silent. The sun sank down the sky, and its sight
slid along the barrels of the rifles from hand-guard
to muzzle whenever the weapons were
moved. Flanagan crunched a biscuit with zealous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
teeth; Bubb traced furrows in the ground
with his trigger finger, but all the time kept his
eyes fixed on the front.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our boys are makin&#39; tea now,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s
about four o&#39;clock, I suppose ... that damned
sun&#39;s in no &#39;urry neither. There!&quot; he ejaculated
suddenly. &quot;One of our boys &#39;as put &#39;is &#39;ead over
the trench! Wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both men heard it, a smothered shriek like
the sound of a drowning puppy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E &#39;as got it in the &#39;ead,&quot; said Bubb in a fierce
voice. &quot;The bloody fool! Flan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Bubb?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw smoke,&quot; said Bubb, speaking calmly.
&quot;Just look over. See a little holler near the
German lines? Yes? Well, there&#39;s a dead
man there wiv &#39;is knees curled up. Got im?
That&#39;s the place. I saw a puff of smoke and
somefing moved. Look, Flan, see somefing
shining?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see it,&quot; said Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sun&#39;s catchin&#39; the sniper&#39;s &#39;ipe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both the youngsters drew their weapons taut
to their shoulders and adjusted their sights.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four-fifty?&quot; inquired Bubb, adjusting his
sight to four hundred and fifty yards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little lower, a little lower,&quot; said Flanagan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
&quot;Make it four and you&#39;ll not be far
out.... It&#39;ll be hard to judge ... if we
hit the dead man. He&#39;ll not raise a dust. You
aim first, Bubb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb&#39;s left cheek twitched, and his eye took
in the objective. He pulled the trigger. A spurt
of dust flew into air a little to the rear of the
dead man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aim low, and we&#39;ll get him next time,&quot; said
Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">Both rifles spoke together. A figure detached
itself from the limp lump which lay in the hollow
near the enemy&#39;s lines, rose to a standing position,
and beat the air with agitated arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus for a moment, then the Thing collapsed
in an abject heap on the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;The boys in the
trench are firin&#39; now. They&#39;ll finish &#39;im off if
&#39;e&#39;s not done in already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rifles cracked spitefully in the trench
which rimmed the base of the slag-heap, the sun
sank lower and the shadows lengthened. The
two youngsters broke biscuits, gnawed vigorously
and waited for the darkness to fall.</p>

<p class="indent">The trench is a world within itself, having
customs, joys and griefs peculiar to its
limitations. The inmates can only claim
for the most part a short existence; they have
degrees of opulence and poverty, but the former
is far removed from those who are legally heirs
to it, and all the dwellers in the trench commune
share their poverty in common. The word
&quot;ours&quot; is on all lips; save for a few relics of
outside civilisation there is nothing which a man
claims as &quot;mine.&quot; Food and drink and clothing
are &quot;ours,&quot; as also are the parcels from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
home, though the men to whom they are addressed
have generally the privilege of opening
them. Money has lost all its value: for the time
being food is not sold here, and all men have to
work at the same job, and they work well, for
the safety of their bodies depends upon the labour
of their hands. Again, in the carping times
of peace a soldier may depend upon the sweat of
others for his daily needs; here in the trenches
he is a Socialist in the highest sense of the much-abused
word.</p>

<p class="indent">The life of the Commune is seldom monotonous,
its uncertainty makes it interesting, its
novelty never wanes. The trench has its history,
every dug-out a legend, and the shell-riven
alleys of war are steeped in tradition. The
narratives of the trench are handed on from
regiment to regiment, a word or two on the firestep
while the battalion just going out changes
places with the relieving battalion, and the
legend of an adjacent dug-out is made plain.</p>

<p class="indent">Such scraps of conversation as these may be
heard. &quot;That dug-out on the left got a &#39;ole in
the roof the other night. A time-expired man
who was going off to Blighty the next day went
in there and lay down to kip. A whizz-bang &#39;it
the roof, and the poor bloke went west.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
&quot;The Germans occupied these trenches at
one time; the Guards charged them, and not a
man escaped. You&#39;ll see their dug-outs all along
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A sniper used to play &#39;ell with this bay a
month ago. &#39;E used to send the bullets into the
trench. It took the men some time to discover
&#39;im. Then they got &#39;im. &#39;E was up on the top
of a chimney-stack in the village behind the
German trench. &#39;E could see right down the
trench. Our artillery brought the chimney down
and the sniper with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the stories are told and retold, and passed
from one set of soldiers to the next who occupy
the trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">No doubt stories become distorted and enlarged
in the course of time, but always there
is a grain of truth in the most exaggerated trench
story; and every tale gives an added interest and
a subtle touch of romance to the locality. The
mean, primitive trench, the home of the Brown
Brethren, is not without certain features of
grandeur, and an atmosphere of mystery pervades
the whole place, due, no doubt, to its close
association with death.</p>

<p class="indent">It was yet dark in the trenches of the Cologne
sector, a much be-shelled locality on Vimy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
Ridge, but a faint subdued flush showed on the
Eastern sky far away behind the enemy&#39;s line.
Stars were twinkling coldly clear overhead and
a keen wind rustled along the floor of the trench.
Vague mutterings and rumblings could be heard
in the dug-outs; the men already warned to
stand to arms on the banquette were snatching
a few moments&#39; extra repose; hugging with
miserly desire at an additional minute&#39;s rest.
Sergeant Snogger came running along the trench
shouting. &quot;Stand to! Stand to!&quot; he called.
There was no particular hurry for the sector was
then a comparatively quiet one. But the sergeant
merely ran because a brisk race was a most
effective means of driving away the sleepy feeling
which was fostered by the narcotic odours
of the dug-out.</p>

<p class="indent">The men turned out yawning and swearing,
then broke into a brisk run round a near traverse
and back again to their posts by the dew-besprinkled
bayonets. One man looked across the
parapet, fixed an indifferent eye on the Ridge,
then burst into a rag-time chorus which a mate
took up with vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">The Zouave Wood, the shell-scarred spinney
where the trees were flung broadcast by high
concussion shells, lay on the left, wrapped in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
shadow and hiding many mysteries. In it was
many a little grave where the kindly earth
covered friend and foe alike. It was a place of
many secrets, of strange and vague whispering.
There, in the dawn, the spirits of the dead men
seemed to hold converse. But by day the earth
could not hide them, the weapons of the quick
dug them again from the graves and flung them
out on the riven spaces of the restless earth.</p>

<p class="indent">The air was cold and keen. The men covered
their chins with the collars of their khaki coats,
lit their cigarettes and leant against the parapet.
They dozed for a moment and then woke guiltily
with a start. Nobody had noticed them, they
dozed again.... The east flushed crimson, the
German trench to the left showed dark against
the glow and stood out distinctly. A sniper&#39;s
bullet ripped a sandbag and a shower of fine
white dust dropped into the trench. No one paid
any heed.... The birds were out hopping
from prop to prop of the barbed wire entanglements.
A lark soared into air pouring out an
ecstatic song.... The dead men on the levels
could now be seen lying close to the earth in limp
and ghastly attitudes, the birds singing above
them.... The sun was up; a million dewdrops
sparkled in a glorious jewelled disarray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
on the wires.... The field had taken on a
greener hue and in many places the daisies
peeped timidly up from the soft grasses....
A white mist circled round the spinney and the
gashes in the trees became more distinct. Looking
southwards down on to the level lands one
could see the Double Crassier tailing out on one
side to the village of Loos and on the other side to
the mining hamlet of Maroc.... Away down
on the left, twelve kilometres away, lay Lens with
its many chimneys, and a number of the chimneys
smoking. The enemy were probably working
the mines. The terra-cotta houses stood out
very distinct and seemed nearer to us than they
really were. The air was very clear and a perfect
flood of brilliant sunshine lit the town, the
enemy&#39;s trench and the dead men lying out on
the field.</p>

<p class="indent">The order to stand down had long since been
given and the men were now busy preparing their
breakfasts. Braziers were alight in the dug-outs
and the red glow of flaming coke stood out in
vivid contrast to the dark interiors. Little
wreaths of pale smoke curled up over the trench
and the air was full of the odour of frying bacon.
Spudhole was frying his bread in the grease and
to judge by the expression on his face he was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
interested in his work. Nothing else seemed to
trouble him. The sniper&#39;s bullet hit the sandbag
again and a spurt of chalk was whisked into the
frying-pan. The youth looked up, obviously annoyed,
and swore whole-heartedly; then he bent
to his work again.</p>

<p class="indent">Breakfast ready, Bubb, Bowdy and Flanagan
sat on the fire-step and ate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve an appetite like the war Casualty List,&quot;
said Flanagan. &quot;It&#39;s always crying for &#39;More!
More!&#39; and is never satisfied. It&#39;s almost as
bad as Bubb when he came back from hospital.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d ravver be &#39;ere than in the &#39;orsp,&quot; said
Bubb. &quot;This breakfast is not to be larfed at.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fare was indeed excellent and every man
did it justice. Each had a mess-tin of tea, a
thick slice of buttered bread and a rasher of
bacon. Tongues were loosened and the talk became
general for there were so many things to
talk about. The week-old papers which came by
last night&#39;s post were read and comments passed
on the contents. A full page advertisement in a
leading daily came in for a fair share of sarcasm.
This advertisement told of the virtues of a wonderful
beauty cream just discovered. It gave a
most delightfully delicate pink flush to the skin
and took away the effects of twenty or thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
years&#39; wear from a woman&#39;s face. It was the
talk of London. All the society women were
using it. Lady So-and-So said so-and-so about
it; the celebrated actress A&mdash;&mdash; vowed that it
was the one thing which England had waited for
since the early part of the last century, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For my own part I wish they invented some-thin&#39;
to take away the crawlers off my clothes,&quot;
Spudhole remarked as he finished his tea. &quot;I&#39;m
goin&#39; to &#39;ave a coot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He got to his feet, took off his tunic and
donned his equipment over his shirt. Bowdy
went into the dug-out to have a few hours&#39; sleep;
Flanagan sat down on the fire-step and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s getting quite hot, Spudhole,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ot as &#39;ell,&quot; Spudhole replied.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a shell burst amidst the poppy
flowers on the open in front of the sector and
Spudhole, who was making his way towards the
dug-out door clapped his hand to his neck and
exclaimed: &quot;I&#39;ve copped one this time; it&#39;s givin&#39;
me gyp!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan shouted &quot;Stretcher bearers!&quot; Then
he turned to help his mate but even as he did so
he felt a sudden penetrating pain pierce his own
chin, and the wasp which was responsible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
sting flew off to a safe distance and poised itself
in the air over the dug-out. Fitzgerald, knowing
that it was contemplating another attack, prepared
to retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s wasps, Spudhole!&quot; he yelled. &quot;We&#39;ll
clear off round the corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But before they moved Bowdy Benners rushed
out of the dug-out, festooned with angry wasps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; he yelled, striking out with both
hands. &quot;I&#39;m stung to death. My pillow was a
nest of the swine! Git out, you vermin!...
Got that one! Did I? He&#39;s stung my finger....
Oh! blast!...&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three retreated at the double round the
traverse and into the next bay. The occupants
were just sitting down to breakfast, a good breakfast,
for the post had come and parcels were
bulky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot the blazes is this?&quot; one of them exclaimed
as the crush of men rounded the corner
waving their arms about their heads. &quot;These
&#39;ere blokes are working their tickets, I suppose!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He finished his remark with a yell, for an enterprising
wasp had flown the rout and stung the
speaker on the nose. Then the insect made the
round of the breakfast party. A few fled instantly
and escaped, others took to their heels at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
the first sting, but the man who waited to pick
up the sultana cake and the tin of sardines had
all the colours of a Board School map on his face
for weeks afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">A narrow, crooked trench infested by furious
wasps is not a healthy locality. The insects outman&oelig;uvred
the soldiers at every turn. The men
turned the third buttress feeling that they had
escaped their persecutors only to find that the
insects had crossed the top of the traverse and
were in waiting round the corner. As a man
runs a trench is a weary pathway, as a wasp flies
it presents no difficulties.</p>

<p class="indent">The place was in an uproar. The wasps had
attacked on both sides, some drove the men left,
others flew after them on the right. In every
bay their numbers seemed to have increased; at
the traverse turning the soldiers eluded them for
a moment only to encounter them in the next bay.
A number of men sought safety in the dugouts;
the wasps followed and drove them out into the
perilous trench again. When the first officer
was met he stood for a moment with one foot in
the trench, one on the firestep, and stared in astonishment.
His wonderment was short-lived.
A wasp announced itself when it alighted on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
ear, and immediately the subaltern became one
with the rout.</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole was now wounded in several places.
The morning had been fine, and like the rest of
his mates, he was in shirt-sleeves fighting order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve copped a sting again,&quot; he yelled. &quot;That&#39;s
umpty eleven times. I always said that I didn&#39;t
&#39;old with a war like this un. Bombs and bullets,
whizz-bangs and pip-squeaks and now these &#39;ere
God-forsaken wopses.... That&#39;s anuver one,
a blurry Boche. &#39;E sniped me from the rim of
me cap.... God! Platoons of &#39;em....
Oh! damn! That un took me at the rear where
I should &#39;ave a patch on me trousers....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again a bay was entered where another merry
party was sitting down to breakfast; a gargantuan
spread of fried bacon, toast and trench tea.
A platoon officer was sharing in the meal. He
was a stout good-natured man with a bald head,
baby-pink and shiny. The advance party of
wasps could not miss the head; the pests came
to a halt on it, and being nasty, they stung when
they alighted. The officer yelled several words
which the men had never noticed in his vocabulary
before. Groping frantically for his hat,
which, as often happens in a crisis, was nowhere
to be found, he overturned the brazier, the toast-rack,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
and several canteens of tea, scalding the
feet of a number of men who were seated on the
firestep.... The soldiers were up in an instant
and raced off along the trench. Rifles, equipment
and ammunition were flung down on the
floor and trampled into the clay and rubble.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point, Spudhole was seized with a
happy thought. A newspaper had fallen on the
fire and was bursting into flame. Spudhole,
seizing the lighted paper, held it close to his face
and kept the wasps away for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But wot is the good of it,&quot; he grumbled as
the flames died down. &quot;I&#39;m getting stung be&#39;ind
and burned in front. I&#39;m off!&quot; and, throwing
the paper down, he fled.</p>

<p class="indent">Struggling, shoving and waving their arms
about, the men hustled along the narrow alley.
Two soldiers scrambled up over the top out into
the open, but, being seen by the enemy, a brisk
rifle fire was opened on them and they fled back
into their wasp-infested shelter again.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Sergeant Snogger was heard.
Seeing two men rushing out into the open field
waving their arms over their heads, he stared at
them open-mouthed and rubbed his eyes with
both hands. A hidden sniper had been potting
at the parapet for days!... The action was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
not in keeping with trench discipline; in fact if
the men did not return immediately they&#39;d &quot;be
damned unlucky!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back! Ye fools, come back!&quot; he yelled.
&quot;Wot the blazes&mdash;was that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wasp swept past his face like a spent bullet,
swung back again and stung him on the forehead.
A second caught him on the neck, a third
on the arm. He turned and ran.</p>

<p class="indent">For Flanagan, he was unlucky enough to have
his puttees off when the stampede started, and
in a few moments a wasp had got up the leg of
his trousers. It stung him half-a-dozen times
before he squashed it to pulp....</p>

<p class="indent">What happened when the Irish rushed into a
Highland regiment on the right must be left to
the reader&#39;s imagination. Never before had the
Gael been so conscious of the nakedness of his
knees. He gave vent to his wrath in vehement
words and it was found difficult to ascertain
whether his anger was directed against the wasps
or the men who were responsible for their coming.</p>

<p class="indent">Was it at the hundredth traverse or the thousandth
that the effectives of the besetting force
lost an appreciable amount of intensity? That
was a matter for conjecture, but this alone is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
known. A jar of marmalade which got overthrown
in a bay enticed the insects, and many
stopped to feast on the disbanded treasure. But
a few followed with unabated ardour; these were
counter-attacked and destroyed, and afterwards
the soldiers bombed the &quot;Bay of the Broken Jar&quot;
with a certain amount of success.</p>

<p class="indent">The Irish strode back defiant and alert, ready
for anything. But the wasps gave no further
trouble; here and there one or two were seen
poised in air over a line of sandbags, but these
fled at the approach of the men.</p>

<p class="indent">The dug-out in which they had originally entrenched
was left in complete seclusion for the
rest of the day, and at night Bowdy and his two
mates approached the place in slow, methodical
order. They found the wasps&#39; nest in a corner
of the wall and poured two mess-tins of boiling
water on it. A third mess-tin remained but it
was not needed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll &#39;ave a drop of char now,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;The evenin&#39;s gettin&#39; cold now and we want
somefing &#39;ot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Righto!&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;I&#39;ll light a fire in
here now that the wasps are gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lit a fire, boiled the water and made the
tea. Outside a sniper was potting at the roof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
of the dug-out. He had been sniping all day,
from where, none could determine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonder what he&#39;s doing it for,&quot; Bowdy asked
as he sat down and reached for the mess-tin
which was bubbling merrily on the brazier.
&quot;He&#39;ll never pot one of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as he touched the mess-tin a bullet ricochetted
off the parapet outside, hissed into the
dug-out and pierced the bottom of the mess-tin.
The tea poured out and extinguished the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that&#39;s past a joke,&quot; Bowdy muttered.
&quot;Blow me blind if I&#39;m not going out to-night to
let daylight through that boundering Boche.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having blackened his face with a burnt
cork, Bowdy Benners fixed his sword on
his rifle and clambered over the parapet
into No Man&#39;s Land. The hour was midnight;
the darkness had settled on the firing line and
the starshells were rioting in the skies. Although
the day had been hot and bright the sky
was now covered with clouds, not a star was visible
and objects quite near at hand could scarcely
be distinguished. The air was warm and still
and not a blade of grass was moving. The only
sound which Bowdy Benners could hear was the
dull rustle of his own clothes as he crawled across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
the level ground on all fours making his way
towards the German lines.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy was out on a great project, an adventure
after his own heart. For many days the
German had been potting at Cologne sector, but
none had been able to locate the position of the
sniper. One thing, however, was evident: he
was stationed somewhere in No Man&#39;s Land.
The German trenches were hidden behind a hillock
and the English trenches were immune from
observation from that quarter.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy crawled carefully forward, his eyes
alert and his ears strained for any untoward
sound. Now and again a flash would light up
the levels in front and he could hear a bullet sing
past his ears towards the sector which he had
just left. But the flash was deceptive and lights
were very misleading in the darkness. The
sniper took care to fire only when a starshell held
the sky above him. In this way, the flash of the
rifle, merging as it did into the flare of the starshell,
could hardly lay claim to a separate existence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to find him,&quot; muttered Bowdy
Benners under his breath. &quot;It&#39;s like looking for
a needle in.... Blimey! That was a near
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
A bullet swept past Bowdy&#39;s head with such a
vicious hiss that he put up his hand to feel if it
had touched him. But he was unharmed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blow me blind!&quot; he muttered, and crawled
forward hurriedly. &quot;Blow me stone blind if that
wasn&#39;t a near go. The bounder can&#39;t see me,&quot;
he thought. &quot;I haven&#39;t blackened my face for
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He continued crawling stealthily on his stomach,
dragging his rifle after him. Every movement
was made softly, but to Benners the sound
of his trousers rubbing on the grass seemed to
carry out as far as the German trenches. Now
and again, as he lay still and stared at the level
in front, he thought he could discern something
moving. Then he would remain absolutely motionless
for a few minutes, listening and watching.
But all was quiet; nothing to be heard save
the wind rustling and a stray mouse running
through a little clump of bracken ahead.</p>

<p class="indent">The sniper had become very quiet now; his
rifle had not spoken for several minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll be having a kip,&quot; Bowdy thought, and
got to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">The long crawl had made his knees sore and
his feet felt numb. Standing upright, he placed
his rifle between his knees and stretched his arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
The light of the last starshell had died away, the
circle of horizon had grown smaller and in the
near distance objects stood out weirdly silhouetted
with a blurred, though definite outline. It
was then that several starshells went up together
and the open was lit with the brilliance of day.
In the glaring light Benners saw the sniper. He
was standing barely a dozen yards away, his hand
resting on his rifle. Benners could see that he
had his sword fixed and the steel shone brightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll make him a prisoner,&quot; Benners said in a
loud voice, and made at the man as a hawk
swoops on a lark.</p>

<p class="indent">The sniper heard Benners approach, turned his
eyes and sprang up to a position of defence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has he a round in the breech?&quot; Benners
asked himself. &quot;Shall I fire at him or not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as he approached, Bowdy saw the German
raise his rifle to his shoulder and a sharp
report rang out. Bowdy blinked at the flash, but
the bullet went wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll settle you,&quot; he said in a loud voice, and,
rushing up, he thrust his bayonet forward. The
sniper parried it and for a moment there was a
brisk duel, then Bowdy saw an opening for a left
point, a favourite of his, which had never failed.
Now, however, it did not work. The sniper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
stepped to the right; by a deft move brought his
own bayonet point downwards to the ground and
Bowdy tripped across it in the rush forward and
went to earth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blow me blind!&quot; muttered Bowdy as he fell,
and made a wild effort to secure his own rifle
which had slipped out of his hands. But in this
he was unsuccessful; the darkness had fallen and
the weapon had disappeared. No doubt it was
lying quite near, but there was little time at
Bowdy&#39;s command to scrutinise the field around
him.</p>

<p class="indent">One hope, however, remained. As Bowdy fell
his legs had managed to close around the German&#39;s
rifle and the barrel of the weapon was held
in a vice-like grip. Bowdy was the strongest
man in the regiment; he was a grand man on the
march, and on the mat a wrestler second to none.
On march or mat he had no equal. He held the
rifle taut for a moment, and in war the moment
is often of supreme importance. As the German
endeavoured to pull the bayonet clear, Bowdy let
go his hold, got to his feet and gripped the man
by the shoulders. For a second both wrestled
fiercely and as they panted and strained the
weapon dropped to the ground. Neither bent to
lift it. A starshell rose into the heavens and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
Englishman had a clear view of the sniper. He
could see that he was deep-chested, unshapely,
bearded....</p>

<p class="indent">He glared at Benners with malignant eyes,
and his lips twisted into a snarl that almost
reached his heavy brows. &quot;You haf no chance
with me,&quot; he grunted. &quot;I am wrestler on English
music halls.&quot; Then, with a yell, he struck
out with both fists for Benners&#39; head, and Bowdy,
wise with the wisdom born of a thousand aching
contests, ducked and dodged, just in time to evade
the blow to the head and the kick which the sniper
aimed for his stomach. Followed a mad tussle
of flying fists and swiftly moving bodies. Then
came an instant&#39;s lull, and the fighters clutched
one another in a tense embrace; Benners&#39; hand
resting on the sniper&#39;s face, the sniper&#39;s fist on
Benners&#39; stomach.</p>

<p class="indent">Breaking from the clinch, Benners stepped
backwards only to return again with a heavy left-handed
blow which took his opponent full on the
jowl; the German never winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A damned professional wrestler!&quot; muttered
Benners and instinctively he knew that he had
met a man who would take any amount of beating.</p>

<p class="indent">Benners crouched, his left foot a trifle advanced;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
his head drawn down well between his
shoulders and shielded by one of his hands. The
other hand covered his stomach. The sniper
paused irresolute for a moment, then, with tiger-like
fury, he swung into his man, striking out
rapidly with both fists. Guarding his body carefully,
Benners waited, ready for an opening, and
when he saw his way he drove heavily with both
hands for the sniper&#39;s mouth. The two blows
went home; the German stepped back several
paces, his mouth dripping with blood. Both had
now forgotten about their bayonets.... Rage
took possession of the sniper, a terrible, murderous
rage, and he was upon Benners, striking
out with his knees, fists and boots. Benners
crouched, holding his body compactly together
and covered his face and stomach with his hands.
For two minutes he struggled to endure. His
enemy was well-nigh resistless, and all the rage
and cunning of the tiger were loose in the man.
Benners went to the ground and was twice kicked
as he curled over in an endeavour to rise, but
seizing a chance he gripped his opponent&#39;s ankle,
and brought him heavily to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">They fastened on to one another as they lay
and still in embrace they got to their feet. As
they stood Bowdy got his hand free and hit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
sniper across the mouth. As if by mutual consent
they broke apart and the sniper devoted the
fraction of a second to wipe his mouth. Then he
rushed in again and Benners backed round to
save himself from a furious onslaught of stinging
blows. The German, vital and overwhelming,
seemed to be in his element. All the essence
of passion, hate and elemental madness found
expression in this onslaught. Thrice a twelve
yard circle of ground was covered, Bowdy fighting
gamely but ever giving backwards. His
body and face were now covered with blood; and
his hands went up, not in battle, but almost in
mute protest against a crushing fatalism. The
terrible charges of the sniper, the lightning
thrusts of the man&#39;s fists were wearing Bowdy
down. Suddenly the German, over-confident,
struck out for his opponent&#39;s head, leaving his
stomach unguarded, and Bowdy saw his chance
and took it. A heavy swing of his left fist
landed on the space between the ribs that fork
outwards from the breastbone, and the sniper
curled up and dropped like a wet rag to the
ground. Bowdy fell beside him and the two men
lay together, quiet as sleeping children.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy turned over on his back and breathed
deeply for a space, then stumbled to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
&quot;I wish I had my bayonet,&quot; he muttered, rubbing
his hand over his brow. &quot;It&#39;s a fight between
two of us, a fight to death.... By God!
he can fight, too. But no wonder; he&#39;s a wrestler.
And I feel done up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy felt very weary. His head was spinning
and he had great difficulty in standing upright.
He had one consolation, however. The
sniper was in as bad a state as he was. He
looked down with vague eyes at the man and saw
that he was recovering from his blow and the
fighting devil was still strong within him. Groping
his way to his feet, the sniper assumed an
attitude of defence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on!&quot; said Bowdy in an energetic tone.
&quot;I have no time to waste and I cannot strike ye
when ye&#39;re sickly like that. Man! Ye should be
ashamed of yerself. Fighter indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;English pig-dog&quot; grunted the sniper and
sweltering into a tornado of incoherent threats
which the Englishman could not understand, he
swept Bowdy round in a ring and landed lightning
blows several times in quick succession. All
the man&#39;s enormous vitality seemed to have been
rekindled, a million beasts of prey were loose in
his body. Benners, struggling fiercely in an endeavour
to live through the tempest of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
enemy&#39;s wrath, groped for a clinch and swept
into its embrace. Here he was safe for a moment
and hoped that the German would consume
his strength. In this anticipated waste of the
opponent&#39;s strength lay Benners&#39; hope of success.
Leaning his chin on the German&#39;s shoulder he
had a moment to look round.</p>

<p class="indent">Unreality and ghostliness lay over No Man&#39;s
Land and an uncanny atmosphere settled on the
levels. Away down by Loos a bombardment had
commenced and the red flashes of the guns lit up
the restless salient. Near at hand could be seen
a barbed wire entanglement, probably the
enemy&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Benners saw the flashes of the shells and asked
himself what the time was. He felt that he had
been fighting for hours and it appeared to him
that he could never get the business to an end.
The sniper seemed stronger than ever now; the
man was surging with life and mad with hatred.
He was a fiend, incarnate, terrible. Bowdy
wondered vaguely as he snuggled his head over
the sniper&#39;s shoulders if the man was tired, if
he felt that the contest had lasted long enough.</p>

<p class="indent">As in answer to the unspoken thought, the
German ducked and caught his man by the
ankles and tried to raise him to his shoulders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
Vaguely it drifted into Benners&#39; mind that the
German intended to throw him head foremost
into the wires and he shuddered slightly and bent
to resist the efforts which his opponent made to
grip him.</p>

<p class="indent">For fully ten minutes both men swayed unsteadily
as Benners disputed every inch of the
ground on the way towards the entanglement.
The sniper was irresistible, and step by step he
urged his man nearer and nearer to the horrible
barbs. Bowdy now knew what the man&#39;s intentions
were and he summoned up all his strength.
The blood from a gashed eyebrow was blinding
him, but instinctively he did his utmost to press
forward in an opposite way to that by which the
sniper was taking him. Clutching and straining,
he resisted gamely until suddenly he felt himself
lifted clean from the ground and resting on the
German&#39;s shoulders. There was a hurried rush
towards the wires, the sniper holding on with all
his strength and Bowdy struggling to break free.
One of his hands stretched over the German&#39;s
shoulders and Bowdy closed his fist and began
to thump the man on the back. With a yell of
rage, the sniper bent down, then straightened his
back quickly and flung Bowdy from him. But he
had miscalculated his throw and Bowdy, landing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
on his feet, had escaped from the danger that
threatened him. But only for a moment. His
man was upon him again and the Englishman
was flung with a crash into the barbed contraption
of war. Bowdy was up in a flash; his
clothes torn and his body aching, and he was
upon the sniper striking out fiercely for his stomach,
landing four lightning blows. His opponent
went down, falling like a log, and lay still.</p>

<p class="indent">Benners, maimed, sore and bleeding, fixed an
imperturbable stare on a rising starshell and the
stare slowly resolved itself into a weary smile.
For fully two minutes he stood thus, silent, with
one eye (the other had been bunged up) fixed on
the scene in front, the barbed wire entanglements,
and the enemy&#39;s trench which showed
clearly, barely eighty yards away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God, it was a fight!&quot; he muttered. &quot;A
damned hard fight. I suppose I must have a
look around for my bayonet now. And a professional
wrestler too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment half a dozen dark forms took
shape on Bowdy&#39;s right. An enemy patrol probably!
Bowdy lay down quietly, rubbed his eyes
and listened. Nothing could be seen now and
nothing could be heard save the deep breathing
of the sniper. &quot;I hope he doesn&#39;t come to and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
kick up a row,&quot; said Bowdy in a whisper. &quot;I
can&#39;t fight a dozen with my fists; one was
enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something rustled on the ground near him and
a head appeared rising over the dark grass.
Then a second head came into view and a third.
The men were crawling towards Bowdy and were
now very near.</p>

<p class="indent">Then a voice spoke in a low whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey!&quot; it said; &quot;there&#39;s nuffink &#39;ere. I
think there&#39;s the German wires.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you, Spudhole?&quot; Benners whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oo&#39;s that?&quot; came the answer. &quot;You,
Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said Benners, getting to his
feet. &quot;Don&#39;t make a noise. Where are you
coming to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re looking for your body,&quot; said Spudhole,
standing upright. &quot;Gawd! We thought ye wor
dead. Wot &#39;ave ye been doin&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been fighting,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;Had a bit
of a row with this man lying here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E looks as if &#39;e&#39;s been in the wars,&quot; said
Snogger, who was leading the search party. &quot;By
Gawd, ye &#39;ave been knockin&#39; &#39;im about....
I suppose we&#39;ll &#39;ave to carry &#39;im back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do whatever you like with him,&quot; said Bowdy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll not be able to help. It&#39;ll be as much as I
can do to carry myself in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The party got back to the trench an hour later.
The sniper was searched and in his pockets was
found in addition to other things, his own photograph
taken when he had appeared on the English
music halls as a professional wrestler.</p>

<p class="indent">He was carried down to the dressing-station
on a stretcher; Bowdy Benners walked down, and
both men were treated by the same M.O.</p>

<p class="indent">A month later Bowdy got a clasp to his
D.C.M.</p>

<p class="indent">In the village the houses were fractured by
high explosive shells, the windows were
paneless and the doors latchless, chimneys
had been hurled to the ground and pounded to
dust. Now in the Summer it was sad to see the
fallen homes of the little people, especially in
these days soft with sunshine, glorious days when
men whispered to themselves secretly: &quot;How
good, how very good it is to be alive.&quot; The mad
vitality of life exulted itself amidst scenes of
demolition and decay; young blood pulsed
warmly, the quick walked through the barren
streets of the village, young men pleased with
their vigour and their calling. Man values existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
in haunts where he holds insecure purchase
of life.</p>

<p class="indent">A solitary violet peeped coyly out from between
two bricks which topped a heap of rubble
by the roadway near the church. The heap of
rubble had once been a home. The cataclysm
of continents, the hatred of kings, the mustering
of armies, the thunder of guns, were all needed
in the making of this&mdash;a mean little nook on a
rubble heap where a modest violet blossomed.</p>

<p class="indent">Like cats to their accustomed haunts the natives
clung to their village and braved danger
and death in preference to exile. But now in the
day of big things the authorities removed the villagers
and sent them back to localities further
away from the firing line.</p>

<p class="indent">The villagers left the place without a moan;
placid fatalists who had lived and died midst the
thunder of a thousand guns; they accepted the
change mutely and left in silence their native
place when ordered to do so. They took away
much of their portable property and left much of
it behind. On the eve of Lammas Day Spudhole
Bubb caught two homeless chickens fluttering
despairing wings outside the estaminet La Concorde
in the village.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ow am I to kill these &#39;ere h&#39;animals?&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
asked Bowdy Benners, who accompanied him.
Bowdy&#39;s face still bore the marks of his encounter
with the German sniper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put a bullet through them,&quot; answered Bowdy,
looking at the chickens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;ll blow &#39;em to blazes,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then wring their necks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like this,&quot; said Bowdy getting hold of a
water-bottle by the neck and swinging it round
his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve a better plan,&quot; said Bubb gazing at the
door of the estaminet. &quot;You open that there
door and I&#39;ll &#39;old the neck of the &#39;en against the
jamb. I&#39;ll say &#39;One! two! free!&#39; And at the
word &#39;free&#39; you swings the door wiv a bang
against the post an&#39; you&#39;ll snick the neck of a &#39;en
like winkin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The operation was performed with great success,
the chickens were decapitated and Bubb&#39;s
thumb was bashed into an ugly purple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a go,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Not much of a
gyme killin&#39; chickens like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much of a gyme indeed,&quot; said Bowdy.
&quot;But they&#39;ll make a good meal, these fowl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An&#39; there&#39;s a bloomin&#39; dawg too as was left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
behind,&quot; said Bubb, pointing his finger at the top
window of the estaminet.</p>

<p class="indent">It was looking down at the two soldiers, a lean
dog with plaintive eyes and a queer crooning cry
which said as plainly as any doggie can say:
&quot;Take me away from this place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why doesn&#39;t it come down the stairs?&quot; asked
Bowdy Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; said Bubb. &quot;&#39;Cos there ain&#39;t no
stairs; they&#39;ve been blown away by a shell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we&#39;ve got to get the poor thing down,&quot;
said Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ow?&quot; asked Bubb, then without giving Benners
time to answer, he said: &quot;Oh, I knows &#39;ow.
There&#39;s a ladder round the corner. We put it
up and take the beggar down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Raising the ladder they placed it against the
window sill, clambered up and rescued the dog
which they placed on the street. Then Bowdy
and Bubb went up the ladder again and entered
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that thing under the bed?&quot; asked
Bowdy who had noticed a dark bundle on the
ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb peeped under and drew back his head as
suddenly as if somebody had given him a blow
on the face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s a dead bloke,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s get out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the street to find the dog lying
on the pavement wagging its tail.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s so pleased with us,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;It
might have died with hunger up there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pleased!&quot; echoed Bubb. &quot;The damned ungrateful
swine! Take that, and that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two kicks were neatly delivered on the animal&#39;s
hindquarters and it rushed off, howling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ate our two blurry chickens and us rescuin&#39;
&#39;im. Anyway we&#39;ve the taters. We&#39;ll get back
to the trench and cook &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll be back as soon as you,&quot; said Bowdy.
&quot;But I&#39;ll run down to Rentoul and get a bottle of
champagne. I&#39;ve a few francs to spare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the trenches Bubb found Flanagan
just finishing a good dinner of fried potatoes
and onions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, I&#39;ve taters, lots of &#39;em and if you give
me some h&#39;onions I&#39;ll make myself a bit of a
feed,&quot; said Bubb to Flanagan. &quot;I do feel empty
inside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve got some onions to spare,&quot; said
Flanagan. &quot;Are you going to cook now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; to cook now,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;but I
want some lard or something greasy for fryin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good idea,&quot; said Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
&quot;What did you fry the taters in?&quot; asked Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I fried them in&mdash;vaseline,&quot; was Flanagan&#39;s
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s quite true,&quot; Flanagan lied, &quot;you
should try it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I will,&quot; said the simple Bubb, and so he
did. He used a whole box of vaseline, frying
his taters on a mess-tin lid placed over a little
fire at the base of a traverse. He ate his portion
with great zest, vowing that he never had
had a better repast in all his life. Part of the
feed he kept for Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan, delighted with the little joke, told
Sergeant Snogger how Spudhole Bubb had used
vaseline in frying potatoes. Snogger came up to
Bubb as the latter sat smoking a Woodbine in
the corner of the dug-out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spudhole Bubb,&quot; he said, &quot;what&#39;s wrong with
ye?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wiv me?&quot; asked Bubb. &quot;There&#39;s nuffink
wrong wiv me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;re lookin&#39; very pale,&quot; said Snogger. &quot;I
never saw a man look as bad. Have ye had no
dinner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
&quot;No dinner!&quot; exclaimed Bubb. &quot;I &#39;ad the best
meal ever I &#39;ad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It can&#39;t have agreed with you,&quot; said Snogger.
&quot;You look as white as a ghost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant walked away and Flanagan
poked his head through the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God, Bubb!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;what has
happened to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Appened to me!&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Nuffink,
man. Wot gyme are yer up to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No game at all,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;But you
look bad. You should go and see the doctor this
evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb looked in the little mirror which he always
carried about with him (he was really a
devil for the girls), and he thought that he was
looking white.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t feel bad,&quot; he said to Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mayn&#39;t feel bad,&quot; said the Irishman,
&quot;but by heaven! you look bad. Is it yer nerves
that are givin&#39; way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve no nerves,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy, who had just returned, was the next
to pass a remark on Bubb&#39;s condition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has happened to you, matey?&quot; he
asked. &quot;You look like a dead hen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m orl right,&quot; said Bubb, but there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
note of concern in his voice. &quot;I &#39;ad the best
dinner ever I &#39;ad a moment ago. There&#39;s some
left for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has it disagreed with you?&quot; asked Bowdy.
&quot;What kind of dinner was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taters and h&#39;onions fried in vaseline,&quot; was
Bubb&#39;s reply. &quot;The same taters that we
got....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vaseline!&quot; Bowdy repeated, &quot;Vaseline!
Vaseline!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot&#39;s wrong wiv vaseline?&quot; Bubb enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s wrong with it, man,&quot; said Bowdy,
&quot;everything&#39;s wrong with it. Devil blow me
blind, it&#39;s poison, pure poison. No wonder
you&#39;re looking white.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb cast an imploring look on Bowdy. He
was now evidently frightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do feel something wrong with me inside,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will see the M.O. this evening.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Bubb had a temperature that evening, whether
due to fright or the ill effects of potatoes fried
in vaseline it was impossible to say. The doctor
sent him back to the hospital at &mdash;&mdash;, a
shell-stricken town where the wounded were confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
to cellars before going further back from
the firing line.</p>

<p class="indent">Wrapped in blankets, Bubb went to sleep on
the floor, and about one o&#39;clock in the morning
he woke up and looked around him. A candle
stuck on the cold ground burned timidly and big
black shadows lurked in the corners of the apartment.
Opposite Bubb an R.A.M.C. orderly sat
on a biscuit box dozing, the unlighted stump of
a cigarette between his fingers. Near Bubb another
patient lay asleep, his mouth wide open,
and his knees hunched up so that they formed a
little hill that dominated the cold clammy floor of
the cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole looked up at the roof where the light
played in little ghostly ripples. As he watched,
a spider slipped out of a hole directly overhead
and dropped slowly down towards his face. In
the half light the spider looked an immense size
and its legs spread out as if endeavouring to
clutch something. Fascinated Bubb watched it
draw nearer, nearer, until it almost touched his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git out ye lobster!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He raised his hand as he spoke and aimed a
blow at the insect and missed. The spider
clambered up again and disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;Blast the bloomin&#39; thing!&quot; he muttered and
turned on his side. &quot;Oh, blimey!... Good
mornin&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A large toad was sitting on the corner of his
blanket, a mere hand&#39;s breadth away, and looking
at him with a pair of big glistening eyes. For
a moment the man and the toad looked fixedly
at one another, then the toad hopped away and
disappeared round the corner of the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, blimey,&quot; said Bubb, cuddling up in the
clothes and trying to sleep. He was unsuccessful
for his mind followed the toad. &quot;Where &#39;as
it gone?&quot; he muttered. &quot;Spiders as big as lobsters,
and toads as big as helephants. This &#39;ere
place is &#39;aunted. Now where &#39;as that &#39;ere vermin
gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned round on his side and again his
gaze fell on the toad. The thing had ascended
the hill formed by the knees of Bubb&#39;s mate, and
there on the eminence it sat, its eyes fixed on the
open mouth of the sleeper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey! It&#39;s goin&#39; to jump in,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;Raise the foresight a little you bounder and
&#39;op!... Ten to one that you miss it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moodily contemplative, the toad sat silent, its
big shining eyes fixed on the cavern in front.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jump, you beggar!&quot; yelled Bubb, shouting at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
the top of his voice. &quot;One good &#39;op and you&#39;ll
score a bull.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fell into a paroxysm of mirth; the
R.A.M.C. orderly awoke, rubbed his eyes, lifted
the cigarette end which had fallen to the floor,
put it in his mouth, and came across to Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s amusin&#39; you, chummy?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The spider and the toad,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;A
big lobster of a spider and then the toad. It&#39;s
tryin&#39; to jump into the man&#39;s mouth. Look
there! Ten to one it misses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; said the orderly with a
bland smile of understanding. &quot;You just lie
down quietly and try and have a little sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the toad,&quot; Bubb remonstrated. &quot;It&#39;s
just goin&#39; to jump.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know, I know,&quot; said the orderly. &quot;I see
it myself. But try and compose yourself,
chummy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, man, it&#39;s real,&quot; said Bubb sitting up.
&quot;Look yourself and you&#39;ll see it. Don&#39;t think
I&#39;m off my napper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think anything of the sort,&quot; said the
orderly still smiling. &quot;I often see things &#39;ere,
myself. You lie down again and you&#39;ll be as
right as rain in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his fingers on Bubb&#39;s pulse, held them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
there for a moment, then pressed the boy gently
back into the blankets.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you there&#39;s a toad,&quot; said Bubb, struggling
to get up again. &quot;Look at that man lyin&#39;
there and see the toad on &#39;is knees. It&#39;s goin&#39; to
&#39;op into the bloke&#39;s mouth in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To humour the patient, the orderly looked as
he was directed and sure enough there was the
toad, a real one, not a phantom originating from
the disordered imagination of a sick man, perched
on the knees of the sleeping patient.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So there is,&quot; said the orderly. &quot;I thought
you were delirious, matey. Well, we&#39;ll put the
thing out,&quot; he said and shoved it off the blanket
on to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;re not a sport,&quot; said Bubb and his voice
was charged with contempt. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you
let it &#39;op? I was bettin&#39; on it. Now my bloomin&#39;
toad &#39;as gone. Bet yer it&#39;ll not come in again
either,&quot; said Bubb sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll bet you it doesn&#39;t,&quot; said the orderly, but
in a different tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb returned to his regiment three days later,
a healthy and wiser man. Afterwards he would
never take part in a conversation wherein vaseline
was mentioned, but the sight of a frog always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
brought memories of toads to his mind, and
all conversation had to be cut dead until Bubb
had narrated for the hundredth time the tale of
a toad in a cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">The stifling heat of the summer day had
given place to the coolness of night and
a big moon rode gallantly amidst the
stars of the dark blue eastern sky. A searchlight
felt the country with a long, pale arm, lighting
up the road, village and wood for miles
around; a galaxy of starshells stood over the firing
line where the meteoric flashes of bursting
shells rioted along the horizon of war.</p>

<p class="indent">Back in a village by La Bass&eacute;e canal lights
shone in the windows of houses and through the
chinks of shutters. The poplars which lined the
village streets showed black and solitary against
the red-brick cottages, their shadows stretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
straight along the pavement spreading out to an
intricate tracery of tremulous boughs which
moved backwards and forwards as the soft night
breeze caught them.... The moonlight rippled
over the roofs, the walls, and the grey, dusty
road; the canal lapped sleepily against its banks;
soldiers walked up and down the streets smoking,
laughing and chatting; women came out
from the cottages bearing pails which they placed
under the pumps and filled with water. All
was peaceful here, only twice had the village been
struck by shells and then the roofs of two houses
had been shattered. In twenty-four hours, however,
the willing hands of the villagers had made
the roofs whole again.</p>

<p class="indent">In the attic of a dwelling that stood by the
riverside, a party of soldiers, three in all, were
billeted. The boys were in a gay, good humour,
for the day had been pay day and two bottles of
champagne had been bought and the second bottle
had just been opened.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy Benners was there, sitting on a bundle
of straw under the niche in which a candle was
placed, surveying the newly-drawn cork with a
lazy smile, his hands under his thighs and his
short, powerful legs stretched out in front to
their fullest extent. He was dressed in shirt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
trousers and socks, his braces were tied round his
waist, his hairy chest was bare, and his identity
disc tied round his massive neck with a piece of
twine was almost hidden in the hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Opposite him sat Harry Bubb, nothing the
worse after his tater and vaseline meal. A
bright sparkle was in his alert eyes, his legs were
crossed and the fingers of his left hand kept
strumming idly on the floor. His right hand
gripped a mess-tin which he pushed towards the
champagne bottle in a slow, guileless manner as
if he was doing it knowingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan was there, stripped to the waist and
rubbing his body with a towel. He had been out
through the village and had just come back,
sweating profusely. He had eaten at a caf&eacute;
round the corner and made a study of &quot;the movements
of masticating jaws&quot; as he expressed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s damned interesting to watch people eat,&quot;
he said. &quot;Some eat slowly as if deliberating
whether they should swallow the food or spit it
out, some eat quickly, trippingly as it were, and
some gorge. Those who eat slowly keep their
mouths shut, those who eat quickly show their
teeth all the time, and those who gorge simply
gorge. We were sitting at a long table and I
was at the end of the seat. I had a look along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
the line of moving jaws rising and falling, at the
man next to me having a canter....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A canter?&quot; queried Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a canter round his teeth with his
tongue,&quot; said Flanagan; &quot;and at the man opposite
whose moving jaw shook his ears until I
thought they would fall off!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan got no further with his chatter. The
door opened, Sergeant Snogger entered followed
by a stranger, and glanced keenly about him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Watch that candle,&quot; he said; &quot;it will fall
down on the straw and burn the whole damned
place out if you are not careful. And that window,
what about it? The light&#39;s showing froo
and you&#39;ll have a shell across &#39;ere if you&#39;re not
careful. You&#39;re not at &#39;ome now, boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Aven&#39;t been in Blighty for eighteen months,
sarg,&quot; said Bubb blandly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a new mate for you fellows,&quot; said
the sergeant, paying no heed to Bubb&#39;s remark.
&quot;&#39;E &#39;as just come out an &#39;e&#39;s for this &#39;ere section....
And another thing,&quot; he said, &quot;I
s&#39;pose you think yourselves lucky gettin&#39; your
pay to-day and gettin&#39; a good night&#39;s sleep to-night
after fillin&#39; your guts with grub and fizz.
Don&#39;t you, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Bubb assented.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
&quot;Well, you&#39;re damned unlucky,&quot; said the sergeant.
&quot;We&#39;ve got ter go up ter the trenches
ter-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey!&quot; &quot;Damn!&quot; &quot;Curse it!&quot; Three
voices yelled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re startin&#39; off as soon as we can, so get
ready,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;Every man wipe &#39;is
wifle wiv a woily wag &#39;fore &#39;e goes, for &#39;e may
need it &#39;fore &#39;e comes back.... Buck to when
you give me a wet and get ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They gave the sergeant a drink and started to
pack up their things. Only when they had finished
and sat down to wait for the call to move
had they time to pay any attention to the new
mate, the boy who had just come out from home.</p>

<p class="indent">He had helped them at the making up of their
kits, oiled their rifles and rushed out to the baker&#39;s
shop near at hand and bought two loaves to
take up to the trenches. When he returned, the
others were sitting on the floor waiting for him.</p>

<p class="indent">He came in with a brisk step, placed the loaves
on the floor and looked at his mates. In carriage
he had a certain individual grace, and his face,
good-looking and youthful, wore an expression
of intense expectation. A traveller within sight
of a long-sought objective might look as that
boy did. His age might be about nineteen, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
looked seventeen. When he saw the men looking
at him, he smiled awkwardly and blushed as
if he had been found guilty of a mean action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, wot d&#39;yer fink of it?&quot; asked Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of this place?&quot; asked the boy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not of this place, but the &#39;ole blurry business,&quot;
said Bubb; &quot;o&#39; this &#39;ere war.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to think of the war, but
I love being out here,&quot; said the boy, putting his
hand in his pocket and bringing out a packet of
cigarettes. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get out before; my
mother spoke to the authorities back in England,
and I couldn&#39;t get away until I was nineteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And ye&#39;re glad to be out &#39;ere?&quot; asked Bubb
in an incredulous voice, then added: &quot;Of course
you are. I was dyin&#39; ter get out &#39;ere myself....
But I know where I&#39;d like ter get now....
Thanks, matey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole put the cigarette in his mouth and
the newcomer lit it with a match. He gave the
others cigarettes also and lit the last three with
the same match; the stranger was the third
smoker. This was not discovered until it was
done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Devil blow me blind!&quot; exclaimed Bowdy Benners.
&quot;He lit his cig&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Then he stopped,
and a moment&#39;s silence ensued.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s always unlucky,&quot; said Spudhole. &quot;D&#39;ye
mind old Stumpy....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold your row, you old woman!&quot; Benners exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The superstition is a modern one,&quot; said
Flanagan, blowing the smoke of a cigarette
through his nostrils. &quot;Invented, I suppose, by
Bryant and May&#39;s to increase the output of
matches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But wot about old Stumpy?&quot; asked Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stumpy be damned!&quot; exclaimed Benners, who
was seldom moved to such a state of excitement.
&quot;Hold your jaw, Spudhole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So we&#39;re going up to the trenches to-night,&quot;
said the newcomer in an eager voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we&#39;re going up,&quot; said Flanagan moodily.
&quot;It&#39;s always going up. I suppose you&#39;ll be
quite pleased going into action for the first time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Delighted,&quot; said the boy, and his hearers
chuckled at the frank admission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s young blood and not knowin&#39; things that
makes you say that,&quot; said Bubb, shaking his head
with an air of wisdom at which his mates would
have laughed if their rest had been assured for
another week. But now as they sat there waiting
for the signal to move up to the fighting line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
which they knew so well, it was a different matter....</p>

<p class="indent">The talk turned to England; the newcomer,
whose name was Frank Reynolds, had much to
tell about home, his people, his life at school, and
above all, about his life in the Army. He was
the only child of a head clerk in a London Bank,
his father had died recently, and now only the
mother remained at home. She lived in Hampstead,
and was rather well to do, having money
left to her by a rich relative. She was very fond
of her boy and would send him parcels twice a
week.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No cigarettes, though,&quot; said Reynolds.
&quot;She doesn&#39;t know that I smoke, and I daren&#39;t
tell. It would hurt her.... I learned to
smoke since I joined the Army; just about three
cigarettes a day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could smoke that many when drinking my
tea,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Conversation ceased at that moment, for the
whistle was blown in the street and the soldiers
were forming up preparatory to moving off to
the trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">The battalion set off and marched along the
road by the river, company after company, with
little connecting files in between. Not the slightest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
breeze was awake, the river was silent, and
the tall, graceful poplars which lined their route
looked blacker and straighter than usual. They
seemed to have gone to sleep even as they stood.
The whole world was in repose, the battalion&#39;s
movement was a sacrilege against the gods of
the still night.</p>

<p class="indent">The very trenches were quiet now, the artillery
riot had died down and only a few starshells rose
into the mysterious heights of the eastern sky.
The company in front set up a brisk pace which
required long, quick strides to follow. Benners&#39;
section turned off from the river and marched up
a steep incline to the top of a low hill opening
out on a wide, far-reaching plain, which under
the pale moonlight, looked more immense, and
merged as it seemed into the distant sky.</p>

<p class="indent">Here and there a tall chimney stack stood high
in air, dark shadows clinging to its base in startling
contrast to the moonlight which rippled like
molten silver over the top. A thin, white mist
trailed across the meadows in long, formless
streaks, bunching in the hollows and breaking
away on the open. The air was full of the smell
of water and mist and growing grass, in short,
of the atmosphere of a summer night.</p>

<p class="indent">Smoking was not allowed. The enemy&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
trenches, miles away though they were, looked
down on the road, and the glowing cigarette ends
might be noticed. Then the road would be
shelled....</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole and Reynolds marched side by side,
with Flanagan and Bowdy Benners immediately
in front. From time to time they spoke of one
thing and another, more especially about their
hard luck in not getting a month&#39;s rest which
had been promised to them for some time. They
had expected to go back on the following morning,
but instead it looked as if they were going
to spend the morrow and a few other morrows
in the trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just our luck,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;It&#39;s always
the same, always and eternally the same damned
grind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do they send up green lights?&quot; asked
Reynolds in a whisper, and added, &quot;They do look
pretty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty!&quot; laughed Bubb. &quot;If you was up in
the trenches now you&#39;d &#39;ear some pretty langwidge.
They&#39;re signals for the artillery to bust
up a dug-out or two, them green lights.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s sending them up?&quot; asked Reynolds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Us, maybe,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;and again maybe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
it&#39;s not us. No one ever knows wot&#39;s wot in this
&#39;ere job. It&#39;s always a muddle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s quiet enough now,&quot; said Reynolds.
&quot;How far are we from the trenches?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About three miles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The battalion entered a village and marched
up a wide street towards the full moon. The
companies in front looked like dark, compact,
heavy masses which did not seem to move but
which could not be overtaken. A pump on the
pavement was running and the water glittered
like burnished silver as it fell to the cobbles. A
shutter hung loose on a window and a woman
came out and tried to fasten it, moving quietly
as if afraid to make a noise. Reynolds was surprised
to find a woman up so late; it was almost
midnight now....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This place is quiet enough,&quot; said Reynolds,
speaking to Bubb. &quot;One wouldn&#39;t think that the
place was so near the trenches.... Do they
ever fire at this village?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;at the other end.
There!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The deep, bass note of a bursting explosive
swept through the village, awaking myriad long-drawn
echoes, and died away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
&quot;Shelling in front,&quot; said Flanagan in a
trenchant whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope it&#39;s not the road,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the road,&quot; said Bowdy Benners.
&quot;It sounded to the left a bit. But you
can&#39;t tell with the echoes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But further conversation was then impossible;
the battalion formed into two files and plodded
ahead.... Round the next corner Frank Reynolds
came in touch with the war. A limber lay
in the middle of the street shattered to pieces, the
two ponies and the driver dead, and a sluggish
trail of something dark crawling away from the
scene of the wreck. Instinctively the boy knew
that he was looking on blood and a queer sensation
gripped the pit of his stomach. At the same
moment he thought of the woman who was trying
to close the shutters two hundred yards away
and a feeling of shame swept through his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I afraid?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;And a
woman going on with her work beside me just as
if nothing was happening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The R.A.M.C. were already at work, not in
the vicinity of the limber, for there all help was
useless, but on the pavement under the shadow
of the poplars where four or five men were lying
down, wounded and groaning.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Here the village had suffered, the houses were
crumpled and shattered, the tiles had been flung
off the rafters, the walls were smashed, the trees
on the pavement were cut to splinters. Big holes
showed in the streets and over all the ruin and
destruction the moon shone calmly and the stars
glimmered. But the atmosphere of the night
had changed; a strange pungent odour filled the
air, and Reynolds knew that he was smelling the
battlefield.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must not tell mother about this,&quot; he said.
&quot;If she knew she couldn&#39;t sleep a wink at
night.... I never thought.... I suppose
there will be worse sights&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At one o&#39;clock in the morning the London
Irish were in occupation of the trenches;
the battalion which they had relieved
were just moving away. Reynolds&#39; section were
lucky enough to find a dug-out, and here they
threw down their loaves and other luxuries which
the Government had not supplied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now we must make ourselves as comfortable
as we can,&quot; said Flanagan as he lit a cigarette.
&quot;I&#39;m for a sleep until it&#39;s my turn for sentry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Snogger, who came to the dug-out door at
that moment, heard the remark and chuckled.
Having some work to do which needed volunteers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
he saw scope for his peculiar type of humour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goin&#39; to &#39;ave a kip, Flanagan?&quot; he asked in a
gentle voice. &quot;Turnin&#39; in fer a spell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just for a while,&quot; said Flanagan; &quot;an hour or
two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well ye&#39;re damned unlucky,&quot; said the sergeant
with a chuckle. &quot;We&#39;re goin&#39; ter raid the
henemy&#39;s trenches. We want to see what they&#39;re
doin&#39;. Indefication purposes ye know. They&#39;re
too damned quiet &#39;ere. And you know when the
German is keepin&#39; quiet ye&#39;ve got to oil yer
hipe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The section was up and alert in an instant;
anticipation flushed every face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m in this &#39;ere game,&quot; said Bubb in a vehement
voice. &quot;Larst time I was out o&#39; it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All&#39;s in it, that is, every man in this platoon
&#39;cept them just out,&quot; said the sergeant. &quot;They&#39;ll
stay &#39;ere an&#39; mind the &#39;ouse while we&#39;re away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going out in the raid,&quot; said Reynolds in
an eager voice. &quot;I want to be in the fun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yer do, do yer?&quot; asked the sergeant, scratching
his head. &quot;Ye never do wot ye want in this
&#39;ere crush, my boy,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;Ye just do
wot I tell you; an&#39; you&#39;ll find that quite enuff,
&#39;fore ye&#39;re &#39;ere very long. If ye do wot I tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
you and do it well ye&#39;re all right. I&#39;ll make it
easy for you. That&#39;s me, Snogger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Reynolds lay back against the wall of the dug-out,
his fair, youthful face lit by the glow of the
candle which Flanagan had just placed in a niche
of the wall. The boy was bitterly disappointed;
the others were going over the top and he was to
be left alone. He opened his lips to say something
and his voice faltered; he was on the verge
of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there any means of getting out with you?&quot;
he asked. &quot;Couldn&#39;t somebody stay back and
let me go in his place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bloke as doesn&#39;t want ter go isn&#39;t in this
&#39;ere regiment,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant, who had just gone outside, returned
carrying a tin filled with a substance black
and soft like soot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now boys,&quot; he said, as he placed the tin on
the floor; &quot;cover yer faces over with this an&#39; be
like niggers. A white face can be seen a good
distance on a moonlight night, an&#39; if ye&#39;re seen
on this &#39;ere job, it&#39;ll be all up with the party&mdash;they&#39;ll
be damned unlucky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An&#39; when ye&#39;ve done that, get arf a dozen
bombs apiece and bring &#39;em wiv you,&quot; the sergeant
continued. &quot;Also, get some brushwood&mdash;ye&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
find it out &#39;ere ready for yer&mdash;and ye&#39;ll
g&#39;over disguised as a shrubbery. We&#39;ll crawl
across, get up to the German trench and fling the
bombs in. Then we&#39;ll come back again, the &#39;ole
lot of us, if we&#39;re lucky.... What the devil&#39;s
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stretcher-bearers brought him in from the
trench, a rifleman with a wound showing in his
shoulder, and placed him on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of the party that was to cross,&quot; said the
sergeant; then asked: &quot;Much &#39;urt, old man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much wrong,&quot; was the reply of the
wounded man. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not in the raid....
I looked across and then my shoulder
burned....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I must get another man,&quot; said the sergeant.
&quot;You&#39;ll do, Reynolds. Get yer face
blacked and get some bombs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men set to work in the dug-out and blackened
their faces, procured their bombs and
branches, and got into raiding order. In ten
minutes&#39; time they were out on the open, thirty
men making towards the German trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan lit a cigarette, put his hands in his
trousers pockets and leant his back against the
wall of the dug-out. Bubb looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yer bloomin&#39; old phizz is sooty enough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Flan,&quot; he said; &quot;but yer teeth don&#39;t arf look
white; they&#39;ll be seen miles away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I should black them,&quot; said Flanagan.
&quot;It would be for my own good. Natural
selection has not fashioned me for this war environment.
Raiding by night is a job for chimney
sweeps. They could walk over to the German
trenches and they would not be seen in the
darkness. Darwin would be very interested in
these raids. If he saw one he would write a
treatise on Artificial Selection and call it The
Survival of the Fittest Disguised. We are disguised;
we&#39;re one with the night. We accommodate
ourselves to our environment like the fox
that changes its coat to white when the snow
comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These &#39;ere branches ain&#39;t arf a barney,&quot; said
Bubb, who understood only a little of what Flanagan
was saying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Birnam Wood! Copied from Macbeth,&quot; said
Flanagan with an air of scorn. &quot;There&#39;s nothing
new in the world. There were trenches and
dug-outs at the siege of Sebastopol.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger came in at that moment, his
body festooned with bombs, his face the colour of
ebony. He looked at his men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot are yer waitin&#39; for?&quot; he asked. &quot;Gawd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
ye are slummicky. Come on, we&#39;ve got to get
across to-night. To-morrow won&#39;t do for this
&#39;ere job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The party went out, crossed the parapet into
No Man&#39;s Land and advanced in open order,
six yards&#39; interval between each man and his
neighbour. Reynolds near the centre of the line,
had Flanagan on his right, Bowdy Benners on
his left, whilst the sergeant, who led the party,
moved warily along, a few yards in advance.
From time to time he halted and waited for those
who followed to come abreast and issued orders
which were passed from the centre to the flanks
in whispers. He used the words &quot;damned unlucky&quot;
whenever he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spread out from the centre,&quot; he cautioned.
&quot;The whole party&#39;s bunchin&#39; up. If the henemy
flings some dirt across, yer&#39;ll be damned unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again he gave the order &quot;Close in in the
centre! You&#39;re losing touch. Some of yer&#39;ll
be goin&#39; in to the German trench all alone; then
yer&#39;ll be damned unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Whenever a star-shell rose in air, the raiders
flung themselves flat to the ground and waited
for the flare to die out. As they went down, they
placed the branches over their heads and held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
them there until the order to advance was given.
Lying thus, they were immune from discovery,
for an enemy patrol ten yards away would mistake
the prone bundles under their covering of
branches for derelict bushes which the fury of
incessant shell fire had spared.</p>

<p class="indent">Star-shells rose at frequent intervals from the
enemy lines; the British sent up very few. This
was the case all along the line. The enemy,
in eternal dread of raids, kept up a continual
watch over No Man&#39;s Land.</p>

<p class="indent">The party, now half way across, lay down, for
a starshell rose from the German trench, stood
high and lit the derelict levels with the brilliance
of day. Then oscillating sleepily from side to
side, it dropped a myriad petals of flame and sank
lazily to earth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re getting the wind up,&quot; said Bowdy
Benners, whispering across to Reynolds. &quot;We&#39;ll
have some dirty work &#39;fore we come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy made no answer. Lying prone, he
listened to the silence. How calm it was under
the great, glorious moon. The levels were in
a dream, a dream of Fairyland, and everything
save the starshells and the glint of light that
played on his rifle barrel was as motionless as
though in a realm of frozen enchantment. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
night drew closer to the boy; it seemed caressing
his young head and body. He even felt sleepy.
It would be good to lie there and rest.</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes looked out in front on a dead man
who lay there, scarcely a yard away. The boy
did not feel afraid. That a dead soldier should
be there seemed quite natural, in keeping with
the new life which the youth had entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose he was killed on a raid,&quot; he thought.
&quot;I wonder if he was going out or coming back....
What would mother....&quot; He looked at
the dead soldier with a fresh interest and his
eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw that the man was dressed in khaki
and he lay on his back, his knees up and his bayonet
pointing in air. From the bayonet standard
to the man&#39;s head stretched an unfinished cobweb
on which the spider was still busily working,
fashioning circle and line. Under the moonlight
the web was a brilliant and beautiful dream....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out o&#39; it, Reynold,&quot; said the sergeant,
who was annoyed because the boy had not heard
the first order to advance. &quot;Spread out a little
on both sides, for we&#39;ve got to keep a look-out
for a henemy patrol. We&#39;re not out on a six
months&#39; tour now,&quot; he added. &quot;If yer &mdash;&mdash;
think so, ye&#39;re damned unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
The men spread out at the double and lay down
again, leaving an interval of some twelve yards
between each man and his neighbour. Reynolds
lay flat, his hand gripping his rifle. Now and
then a breeze rustled across the levels, set the
poppy flowers nodding to one another, and died
away again. The smell of the wet grasses and
the damp earth was in his nostrils, and the narcotic
odour of the soil almost lulled him into
slumber.</p>

<p class="indent">A mouse rustled along the ground in front, in
and out amongst the nodding poppy flowers and
disappeared. Near him somebody stifled a
cough, but the sound struck harshly on his ears.
Apart from that, silence and suspense.</p>

<p class="indent">He lay flat, his face on his hands, his legs
stretched out to their full extent, and listened.
Well to the left a mate whistled; something had
aroused his suspicions, probably the enemy patrol.
A bird rose from the grass, shrieking as if
in pain, and flew away. The lights died out;
the level fields looked deathlike.</p>

<p class="indent">A starshell rose up to the sky and settled over
Reynolds&#39; head. Under its light the country
seemed to become more immense, it stretched out
on all sides into endless distances.... He lost
consciousness for an instant.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;Well, the night is very long in passing,&quot; he
said in an audible voice, opening his eyes for a
moment. &quot;I am very sleepy, but if I doze off
something may happen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had a desire for something exciting to take
place, something that would keep him awake.
He even felt hungry, and did not particularly
want to fight. Even a sleepy boy does not like
fighting at two o&#39;clock in the morning on an
empty stomach when there was so much to eat
near at hand.... How strange that he had not
noticed it before. Probably he had been looking
in the wrong direction. But there out in front in
the midst of the poppies stood a house with the
windows brilliantly lighted up and a girl standing
at the door. From the way she laughed when he
approached he knew that she was glad to see him.
She made way and he entered the dining-room,
where the table was spread out for dinner. The
food was not laid yet, but on a table in the corner
he could see a grand array of steaming dishes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s splendid,&quot; he said. &quot;Not like army stuff.
It&#39;s....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl whom he met at the door came into the
room, approached the table in the corner, and
brought over a plate of soup, which she placed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
front of him. He looked for a spoon, but could
not find one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve forgotten,&quot; he said to the girl. &quot;I
haven&#39;t got a spoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How stupid of me,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;m awfully
sorry. I was thinking of something else.
But now I&#39;ll get a spoon. I always carry a spoon
no matter where I go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I,&quot; was Reynolds&#39; answer. &quot;I always
carry a knife, fork and spoon in my pack.
They&#39;re gone now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl disappeared for a moment. When
she came into the boy&#39;s world again she carried
a spoon in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is for you,&quot; she laughed. &quot;It&#39;s silver-plated
with a monogram&mdash;your own monogram.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke she lifted his soup and rushed off
with it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back with the plate,&quot; cried Reynolds,
rising to his feet. &quot;I haven&#39;t eaten yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t get excited,&quot; she called back over her
shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ll pass it along in a moment. I&#39;ll
pass it along, pass it along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A strange harshness had crept into her voice,
and the youth swept back into reality. The man
on his right was calling to him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;Pass it along,&quot; he called out in a loud whisper.
&quot;Pass it along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the message?&quot; Reynolds asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The right flank reports seeing an enemy patrol,&quot;
was the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy passed the message to the left but
got no acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose the man there is asleep,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;I&#39;ll go along and see him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lifted his rifle and stumbled along through
the gloom. When a light went up he stood still
and waited for the darkness to resume his journey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, here he is,&quot; he said, when a flare lit up
the night and showed him a figure in khaki lying
flat on the ground. &quot;Asleep, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wake up, man,&quot; he shouted, when he reached
the motionless figure, bringing his hand down
with a smack on the man&#39;s back. The shoulders
gave way beneath the force of the blow. His
hand seemed to sink into the soldier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; he gasped. &quot;It&#39;s a dead man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He left the poor thing hurriedly, found a man
asleep, woke him up, delivered the message and
made his way back to his post.</p>

<p class="indent">The strange experience had unnerved him and
he lay down again, feeling that a huge dark form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
was standing behind him watching every movement
on his part. A breeze had risen and the
waving grasses wailed a dirge in dismal unison.
From somewhere far away a dog whined mournfully....
The order to advance was given.</p>

<p class="indent">The men went forward at the double for a
space and flung themselves down flat when they
reached the enemy&#39;s barbed wire entanglements.
Those in the centre of the party could not get
across; the wires in front of them stood sturdily,
untouched by artillery fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lie low,&quot; the sergeant whispered to Bowdy
Benners, &quot;and pass the word along to the left.
Ask them if there&#39;s an openin&#39;. The same message
to the right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The seconds crawled by until the answer came
back from the left. &quot;Opening here. Shall we
go through?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pass the message to the right and tell them
to close up,&quot; said the sergeant to Benners.
&quot;Also, those on the left, get through and lie
down on the other side of the wires until we
join them. Pass it along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The message went its way and the men in the
centre followed it, stumbling and crouching low
to avoid the eyes of the enemy sentinels. Reaching
the opening, they lay down, their heads under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
the branches, and waited for the party to close
in.</p>

<p class="indent">Reynolds had a good view of the enemy&#39;s
trench as he lay on the ground a dozen yards
away from the reverse slope of the parapet. He
saw the sandbags tilted at strange angles looking
for all the world like dead men huddled together
in heaps. Immediately in front lay an
unexploded shell perched on the rim of a small
crater, and near it was a wooden box and a heap
of tins. Somebody in the trench was singing a
song in a low but clear voice. The night was
full of the smell of burning wood; probably the
Germans were cooking a meal.... Bowdy
Benners and the sergeant lay in front of Reynolds,
immovable as statues,&mdash;both might have
been dead.... Benners turned slowly round
and crawled back again with a message.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When the sergeant lifts his branch and holds
it over his head, prepare to advance,&quot; he whispered.
&quot;Get your bombs ready to throw....
Pass it along to right and left.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fascinated Reynolds watched the sergeant,
saw him lie still as ever for a full minute, then he
raised the branch and held it over his head for an
instant, brought it down again and got to his feet.
As one man the party rushed forward to the rim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
of the trench and began to fling their bombs in
on the occupants. There was one explosion, then
a second, a third and a fourth.... The Germans,
taken unawares, raced from one bay to another,
but the bombers waited for them at every
turning. In their eyes the attack might have
been delivered by an army corps. Death had
crept up in the night out of the unknown. Men
fell, yelled in agony, and became silent, their white
faces showing ghastly on the floor of the trench
when the smoke of the explosions died away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damned good work! Keep at it, boys!&quot; yelled
the sergeant, standing on the parapet and drawing
a pin from the shoulders of a bomb. &quot;They&#39;re
damned unlucky this &#39;ere time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He threw his missile at a German who was
trying to enter the door of a dug-out, and stepped
back to avoid the explosion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, it&#39;s a barney!&quot; said Bubb, looking
down in the trench. He had come to his last
bomb, and wanting to &quot;make it tell,&quot; he threw it
into a dug-out door which showed in the wall of
the parados. Followed an explosion accompanied
by agonised yelling....</p>

<p class="indent">Twenty yards away Reynolds stood on a sandbag,
a bomb in his hand, his eyes fixed upon a boy
about his own age who, crouching against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
wall of the trench, was looking up at him. Reynolds,
full of military ardour, had rushed up to
the attack when the order was given, and was
on the point of flinging the bomb into the trench
when he noticed the young German standing motionless,
paralysed with fear. Reynolds raised
the bomb with the intention of throwing it, then
brought it down again. The terrified foe frightened
him. In the heat of passion, Reynolds would
have killed him, but to take away the life of that
shivering, terrified creature was not a job for
the youngish newly-out. He gazed at the German,
the German returned the gaze, perplexity
looked at dread and became horrified. Killing
was not an easy matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Reynolds drew back a pace, his eyes still fixed
on the foe. The battle raged around him; the
flash of the bursting bombs almost blinded him,
the explosions shook the ground ... the flying
splinters sang through the air.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the order to retire came down the
line; a brown figure rushed up to Reynolds shouting
something about &quot;getting out o&#39;t,&quot; seized the
bomb which the youngster held and flung it into
the trench on the youthful German.</p>

<p class="indent">The party retired hurriedly; their work was
completed. &quot;The sooner back the safer,&quot; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
sergeant yelled. &quot;They&#39;ll open up a machine
gun now and we&#39;ll be damned unlucky if we don&#39;t
grease back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Already the enemy&#39;s rifles were speaking and
bullets swept by with a vicious hiss. The men
stumbled through the opening in the barbed wires
and rushed into the levels. Benners and Reynolds
ran out together chuckling, pleased, no
doubt, at the success of their enterprise. Bubb
and Flanagan followed; the latter had lost his
rifle and vowed that he was always unlucky.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Reynolds fell headlong to the
ground. He was on his feet immediately and
rushing forward again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the damned wires,&quot; said Flanagan.
&quot;They&#39;re scattered all over the place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, Reynolds went down for the second
time, but did not rise again. Benners came
to a halt and stooped over him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you hit, chummy?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got it through the breast,&quot; the boy replied.
&quot;It was that which brought me down the last
time, not the wires.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Reynolds was surrounded now by his comrades.
He was sitting half upright, his head
sinking towards his knees, the martial elation of a
few minutes ago utterly gone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&quot;Well, chummy, you&#39;ll be all right in time for
breakfast,&quot; said Bubb, who expected that these
words would buoy up the youngster&#39;s courage.
But Reynolds seemed to pay no heed, a cold and
sorrowful expression settled on his white face,
which looked strange and unearthly in the light
of the moon. The sergeant cut open the youth&#39;s
tunic and looked at the wound, which showed
red over the heart. There was very little bleeding.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! you&#39;ll be all right in no time,&quot; said the
sergeant in a voice which was strangely soft and
kind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; said the boy, in a scarcely audible
whisper. &quot;Leave me to myself, please.... I&#39;ll
not live very long.... It&#39;s too near the heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These were the last words which the men heard
him speak. Ten minutes later he had passed
away.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;I knowed it would pan out that way,&quot; said
Bubb, as he sat in his dug-out two hours later
drinking hot tea from his sooty messtin.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dawn, the sun came up red in the east
and the dewdrops glittered like diamonds on the
levels.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
&quot;&#39;Twas the same wiv old Stumpy. &#39;E was
the third man to light &#39;is fag wiv the same match,&quot;
said Bill. &quot;Then &#39;e went up to the trenches an&#39;
&#39;e was shot dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all damned rot,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;I
knew men getting killed who never smoked a
fag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a feeling that Reynolds was going under,
anyway,&quot; said Benners. &quot;And he was such
a good boy, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I liked him better than I cared to say,&quot; said
Flanagan. &quot;He was as eager as hell. And he&#39;s
dead. He didn&#39;t have much of a run for his
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Takin&#39; it all in all, we&#39;re not so blurry badly
off,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;I wunner if we&#39;re goin&#39; ter
get relieved soon. I &#39;ope so, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The road by La Bass&eacute;e Canal was gritty
and dry and shone like a thread of gold
in the afternoon sunlight. The Canal,
dark and oily, was broken by hundreds of little
petulant ripples; its banks were red with poppy
flowers. Quiet reigned in the village of Gorre,
where the London Irish were quartered. They
had been out digging trenches at Cambrin
the night before. Having been relieved from
the fighting line, two nights after Reynolds&#39;
death, they were now supplying working parties
to the trenches near La Bass&eacute;e. In the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
war the pick and shovel are as important as the
rifle and bayonet.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb, Flanagan and Bowdy had just got up
from the straw on which they had been lying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s have a bloomin&#39; dip in the briny,&quot; said
Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; said Bowdy and Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">The trio made their way out into the village.
It was a glorious day. The sky was a tender
blue, the green branches of the poplars which
lined the street waved sleepily, the shadows of
many little clouds glided across the cobbled
pavement. To eastward other little clouds
formed suddenly and as suddenly paled away,
and the men knew that an artillery duel of slight
intensity was in progress by Cuinchy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This ain&#39;t a bad place for a billet,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;I could stick &#39;ere for duration.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll soon be out of it now,&quot; said Flanagan,
handing round a packet of cigarettes. &quot;Captain
Thorley said this morning that we are going
to trek to the Somme. Big doings down that
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re always in it when there&#39;s a row on,&quot;
said Bubb. &quot;It&#39;s no sooner see and like a place
&#39;ere than you&#39;re out&#39;t next day. There are some
fine birds in this &#39;ere place too.... Look there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
are the cooks gettin&#39; dinner ready. Gawd they&#39;re
sweatin&#39; at the job too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A field kitchen stood in the church square and
the smoke curled up from the sooty funnel and
paled away in the clear air. Here the company
cooks were busy preparing dinner. Facing the
Canal was a row of red-roofed houses, with a
wealth of summer flowers round the doors, the
windows looked out coquettishly through roses,
and green ivy clambered up the walls.</p>

<p class="indent">To the left of the church was a snug little
graveyard hidden in a spinney, and here a number
of English soldiers were buried. Under a
large tree stood a broken and rusty pump which
was out of action. A large shell had fallen there
and after the explosion some soldiers found a
robin, dead. They buried it and were moved to
poetry in inscribing the little bird&#39;s epitaph. The
epitaph, written in large black letters, hung from
the handle of the pump. This was the verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Cock Robin lies beside this pump,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A coal-box hit him such a thump,</span><br />

<span class="i0">We&#39;ll lick the swine that fired the shell.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Bubb looked at the epitaph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mind the one over Sergeant Slade at
Maroc?&quot; he remarked.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not as good as the one at the Cabaret Rouge
up at Souchez,&quot; said Flanagan, and quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we&#39;ll go into the caf&eacute; and have a
drink,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;Bubb won&#39;t refuse to go
in, I know. He wants to see Emily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s yourself as wants to see the bird,&quot; said
Spudhole. &quot;I don&#39;t mind sayin&#39; that I kind o&#39;
like &#39;er. She&#39;s not bad lookin&#39;, almost as nice
as Fifi. Mind Fifi, Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor old Fifi,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;Fitz was fond
of her. I remember one night seeing him kissing
her over the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;That was when we
were at Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm, and I was lying in the
straw up in the barn. Snogger and Fitz and Spud
and myself came in from the caf&eacute; and all went
to bed, except my bold Fitz. He sat up and I
watched him. After a while he thought everyone
was sleeping and up he gets and goes downstairs.
I waited for ten minutes, but he didn&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
come back, so out I goes and down to see what
he was up to. And what would it be but Fitz
at the back of the farmhouse speaking to Fifi and
kissing her. Well, it wasn&#39;t my business to spy
on him, so back I comes to my roost and I was
asleep before he came back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always knew that &#39;e was a devil,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;Pity that &#39;e went west.... &#39;Ere, can yer
smell the roses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They came to the door of the caf&eacute; and entered.
Emilie was inside sitting at a table writing a
letter. She smiled at the soldiers and went on
with her work. Bubb lit a cigarette, sat on a
chair and mumbled a song.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Woola woo donna maw,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Siv woo play,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pan ay burr</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ay cawfee ah lay.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The girl raised her head and laughed, disclosing
her pearly white teeth and red lips.
Emilie was a well-made girl with dark hair,
white brow, thick, strongly arched eyebrows, a
charming chin and a full throat. She was of
medium height, full of vitality and fun, a coquette
every inch of her. Bubb was in love with her,
just as he had been in love with dozens of other
French girls. A billet and a bird, and no man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
out of the trench area could be happier than
Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">Having drunk their coffee, the soldiers made
their way to the Canal.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb&#39;s face was brimming over with good
nature and vitality. Now and again he would
jump into the air, cut a caper with his feet, hop
to earth as gracefully as a bird, kick a pebble
along the roadway, and afterwards lift the pebble
in his hand and fling it into the water.</p>

<p class="indent">A boy, wearing a pair of English puttees drove
two lean cows along the Canal bank and stopped
for a moment to speak to an elderly female who
was washing her household linen in the cool
water. Heedless of the woman&#39;s presence,
Bowdy and Flanagan undressed and flung themselves
into the Canal. The swim from bank to
bank was very exhilarating, the coolness warmed
the heart and imparted a strange exhilaration to
the body. A swim in the cold water always gave
the two men the same sensation as good news
that is unexpected. Bubb sat on the bank looking
at the swimmers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come into the water, my man,&quot; they shouted.
&quot;It&#39;s glorious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twon&#39;t be so glorious when yer get out
again,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
&quot;Why?&quot; Flanagan enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Cos yer clo&#39;es are right top o&#39; a hant-&#39;eap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An ant-heap!&quot; ejaculated Flanagan. &quot;Oh,
my God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not goin&#39; ter leave my clo&#39;es wiv yours,&quot;
said Bubb. &quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; ter leave &#39;em where
there&#39;s no bloomin&#39; hants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll get stung to death,&quot; Bowdy said.
&quot;Bubb, put our clothes along with yours,&quot; he
called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No blurry fear,&quot; shouted Bubb, who was undressing
further along. &quot;I don&#39;t want to get
no hants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The swimmers only ceased in their endeavours
to drench him when he flung half-a-dozen bricks
into the water perilously close to their heads, but
it was only Bubb&#39;s trudgeon stroke that saved
him from a combined attack when he dived into
the Canal. Bubb was a graceful swimmer.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy was just clambering up on the bank
when he heard it coming, rumbling in from the
Unknown. He was back in the water immediately,
beating it with his hands as he waited. The
shell burst near the bank and a hundred splinters
whizzed into the Canal. A second shell followed,
and a third. Then it was that Bubb&#39;s
clothes, caught fair, were blown in pieces....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
For ten minutes the men kept in the water,
but when no further shells came across from
the Germans, they clambered out on to the
bank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All hail, thou twentieth century Adam!&quot;
said Flanagan, looking at Bubb and shaking the
ants from the bundle of khaki clothing. &quot;It
will be splendid to see you march through Gorre
on your way back.... And all the young
girls....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb looked round in agony; Bowdy shook
with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And French girls, too,&quot; said Flanagan.
&quot;They&#39;re very rude sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll have a little procession,&quot; Bowdy suggested.
&quot;Bubb leading.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a sad plight for a bashful man,&quot; said
Flanagan. &quot;An exhibition in the nude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb opened his mouth and shut it again.
Bowdy and Flanagan put their boots on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If only I &#39;ad a sandbag,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll get back now,&quot; Bowdy said. &quot;Come
along, Spudhole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No blurry fear,&quot; said the Cockney. &quot;I&#39;d
drown myself &#39;fore I&#39;d go back through Gorre
like this. I&#39;m not a girl in a revue. I&#39;m a
soldier, not a hactress. Will one o&#39; you run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
back and get a pair o&#39; trousers and a shirt for
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Callin&#39; yerselves mates!&quot; shrieked Bubb.
Then his voice became coaxing. &quot;Look &#39;ere,
Flan, you go back and get me even a shirt; or
Bowdy.... Any of you. Be pals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who stood by and let the ants run over our
clothes?&quot; asked Flanagan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bubb,&quot; Bowdy replied. &quot;Our pal, Spudhole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was a joke,&quot; said Bubb, &quot;but this is
past a joke. It&#39;s &#39;ell &#39;avin&#39; no clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you wouldn&#39;t wear clothes with ants running
over them, would you?&quot; asked Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go on in front,&quot; said Flanagan.
&quot;I&#39;ll ask Emilie to come down and have a look
at you. She&#39;s up to any kind of devilment, that
same girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Flan-a-gan,&quot; said Bubb in a slow voice,
hoarse with decision, &quot;if you&#39;d do a thing like
that, I&#39;d cut yer blurry froat.&quot; Then he stooped
down, picked up a pebble and flung it into the
water.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ere, wot&#39;s this?&quot; he exclaimed suddenly.
&quot;This, in the Canal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
They looked in. A stretcher, to which a
ground sheet was bound by a leathern thong,
drifted slowly down the Canal. Quick as a
flash, Bubb dived in and brought the stretcher
to the bank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carry me &#39;ome on this,&quot; he said. &quot;Put the
ground sheet over me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He lay down on the wet stretcher and his
mates covered him over with the sheet and raised
the burden to their shoulders. Spudhole regained
his good humour and began to sing. He
was in the throes of a rag-time chorus when
Flanagan and Bowdy halted opposite the Caf&eacute;
Calomphie and placed the stretcher on the pavement.</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan knocked at the door. Emilie came
out. Bubb sweated terror from every pore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take me away!&quot; he yelled, wrapping himself
very tightly in his sheet. &quot;For Gawd&#39;s sake
take me back to the billet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Agitation and confusion distorted his countenance;
at that moment he longed for the ground
to open and swallow him. Flanagan, who
knew French like a native, was speaking to the
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Spudhole called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wants the ground sheet,&quot; said Flanagan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m going to make her a present of
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Gawd&#39;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s going to take it off herself, with her
own two hands,&quot; Flanagan remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, blimey!&quot; groaned Bubb; then, in an
excess of rage, &quot;I&#39;ll kill &#39;er if she comes near
me. I&#39;ll strangle &#39;er, then I&#39;ll strangle you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Bubb&#39;s violent gestures did not deter
Emilie from approaching the stretcher. She
knew all about Bubb&#39;s mishap. Flanagan had
explained his mate&#39;s woeful plight. Emilie
bent down and raised the lower part of the
ground sheet, disclosing Bubb&#39;s toes.</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole curled up like a hedgehog. The girl
gave the sheet a slight tug.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pour moi!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git out!&quot; yelled Bubb. &quot;Clear off ter &#39;ell.
Damn yer, don&#39;t yer know wot shame is! Ally
voos ong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull it off, Emilie,&quot; roared Flanagan, holding
his sides.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl gave the sheet another tug. She did
not want to take it off, but Bubb&#39;s terror amused
her.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy could stand it no longer. He got to
his feet, wrapped the sheet round his waist and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
fled up the street. The village came out to see
him careering along; all laughed at the escapade
but few were surprised at the spectacle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s only the mad English,&quot; the old women
said. &quot;They are always up to mischief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That night the London Irish set out on their
trek to the Somme.</p>

<p class="indent">The trench was quite a good one for the
Somme, about six foot deep with here
and there a few dug-outs where men
could sleep and eat.</p>

<p class="indent">There, on a certain autumn morning, we find
the men of the London Irish again, waiting to
cross No Man&#39;s Land and attack the Germans.
A month has passed since they left Gorre and
during that time they have seen much fighting in
which they have earned great renown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re too well known,&quot; Bubb often remarked
bitterly, but beneath all his grumbling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
it could be seen that he was more than a little
proud of his regiment. &quot;We&#39;re too well known
that&#39;s wot it is,&quot; he would continue. &quot;If there&#39;s
anything to be done oo&#39;s to do it? Us. We&#39;re
always in the thick o&#39; it. If the &#39;eads &#39;ear that
there&#39;s a stiff job to be done and it wants an
army corps to do it, wot do the &#39;eads say. They
say: &#39;Put the London Irish, the footballers of
Loos on the job. They&#39;ll soon do it.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On this morning Bubb was preparing breakfast
in a dug-out while Bowdy Benners was
sleeping in a corner and Flanagan was out on
the parapet watching for Tanks. These monsters
were going to cross presently, but as yet they
were not to be seen. In front, the self-sown
crops were waving in the breeze, and the barbed
wire entanglements showed red and rusty over
the meadows. Nothing of the German wires
remained; they had been blown to bits. The
German trenches could be seen in front, dipping
out of sight into a natural valley on the left and
losing all outline amongst the tree stumps on
the right. The stumps were all that remained
of the well-known High Wood; the locality was
pitted with shell-holes and littered with dead,
friend and foe, who lay together in silent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
communion. The Germans still held the
wood.</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb, having prepared breakfast, went to the
door and called Flanagan in, then he turned
round and kicked Bowdy on the shins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git out &#39;t,&quot; he said. &quot;Ye&#39;re not going to
fight on an empty tummy, are yer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flanagan came into the dug-out. &quot;That
smells A.1.&quot; he remarked. &quot;But the Tanks,&quot;
he said. &quot;I can&#39;t see them yet. I hope they&#39;re
not late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope they&#39;re not,&quot; Bowdy replied, and
yawned. The arrival of the Tanks did not interest
him apparently. He reached out his hand
for the mess-tin of tea and drank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re givin&#39; them &#39;ell wiv our guns,&quot; said
Bubb. &quot;Blowin&#39; the place to &#39;ell.... That&#39;s
a good drop o&#39; tea, ain&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, it&#39;s damned good,&quot; Flanagan replied.
&quot;I&#39;m out for a V.C. this time, anyhow....
Where&#39;s Snogger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s outside, somewhere,&quot; said Bowdy.
&quot;He thinks that he&#39;ll not come through this
scrap. He is quite nervy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind &#39;avin&#39; a job at these &#39;ere
tanks,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;It&#39;d be damn good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
sport.... &#39;Ave another piece of bacon,
Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Bowdy replied, taking the half
rasher which Bubb handed to him. &quot;I&#39;m
damned hungry.... Here, did you see Captain
Thorley this morning. He was giving cigarettes
away. Turkish they were; must have cost
a penny apiece. Fat ones, like a cigar almost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E&#39;s a good bloke, old Thorley,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if the tanks are in sight yet,&quot; said
Flanagan. &quot;They&#39;re goin&#39; to make a clean
sweep of all the High Wood.... What&#39;s the
time now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A quarter to seven,&quot; Bowdy replied, looking
at his wrist watch. &quot;It&#39;ll all be over at ten
o&#39;clock one way or the other The Guards
and Northumberland Fusiliers are round one side
of the wood and it&#39;s almost closed in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having finished their breakfast, the men went
outside into the trench. The shells could be
heard bursting on the German lines, and the
enemy were replying. The machine guns were
going pit-pit, and bullets were ripping the English
sandbags.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, look!&quot; shouted Bowdy Benners,
pointing at the sky overhead. His two mates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
looked up to see an aeroplane making its way
across to the enemy&#39;s lines. It was followed by
two, three, half-a-dozen, flying low.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, the tanks!&quot; somebody shouted, and
a line of faces peeped over the sandbags. One
man in Benners&#39; bay got hit through the head
and fell to the floor of the trench. The remainder
drew back discreetly and kept their heads under
cover. Sergeant Snogger appeared suddenly,
smoking a cigarette and paring his nails with a
clasp-knife. He leant his back against the parados
and looked at the trio.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheero, sarg,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Fancy yer
chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not &#39;arf,&quot; said Snogger. &quot;It&#39;ll be a walk-over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pass the word along for Sergeant Snogger,&quot;
came the message up the trench.</p>

<p class="indent">The sergeant closed his knife, put it in his
pocket and rushed round the traverse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t see the tanks,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;There
are none &#39;s far as I could see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw one,&quot; Bowdy said. &quot;Over on the
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There were two,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;Crawlin&#39;
along as if they were pickin&#39; up worms. Big,
ugly lookin&#39; brutes they were. God! they&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
make the Germans sit up.... You have yer
helmet twisted round, Bubb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb adjusted his helmet, lit a cigarette,
pulled his rifle towards him, cleaned a speck of
dirt from his bayonet, then put his rifle back to
its original place. Bowdy and Flanagan followed
the movement with intent eyes. From
their look it might seem as if their very existence
depended on the job which Bubb had done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s some strafing,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;The
Germans are getting enough to go on with, anyway.
Phew!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three men crouched to avoid the fragments
from a shell which burst on the parapet to the
left. Somebody called out for stretcher-bearers
and the message sped along the trench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;ll be quite easy getting across here,&quot; said
Bowdy. &quot;One whistle and up you go and the
best of luck. Here, I haven&#39;t got a cigarette....
Oh, yes, I have, here they are, I
put them into the wrong pocket. Have one,
Flanagan&mdash;one Bubb?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb took the cigarette, placed it behind his
ear and continued smoking the one which he had
in his mouth. &quot;I&#39;ll keep this&#39;n to smoke when
we get across there,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s about time to move now,&quot; said Bowdy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
and he raised his head cautiously and looked
over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re making head-way.
No damned stopping them. Bravo! the
tanks! Good old tanks!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo!&quot; said Bubb, sticking his head over.
But he pulled it back quickly, for a bullet ripped
a sandbag beside him, and a handful of clay and
chalk was slapped into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gawd, that&#39;s a bloomin&#39; poultice,&quot; he muttered,
ducking down and wiping the grit from
his eyes. &quot;It &#39;asn&#39;t knocked my &#39;ead off, but I
feels as if it &#39;as.... I&#39;m not goin&#39; to look over
again till the whistle&#39;s blown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy Benners placed a mirror on a bayonet
and held it over the trench. Looking in it he
could see the field in front, the barbed wire entanglements,
the shell-holes, the German trench
on which the shells were falling, gouging out the
occupants. And the tanks. Yes, he could see
them crossing, mammoths moving forward with
irrevocable decision, serious minded leviathans
which knew their business and went about it in
a deliberate manner. Bullets rattled on their
hides, struck sparks out of their scaly armour,
but had no effect on the air of detachment with
which the great monsters in steel pursued their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
inexorable way. Nosing complacently forward,
they crawled down into shell-craters, hiccoughed
up again, straightened themselves out, and
stealthily pursued their way towards the enemy
trench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re getting on,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;We&#39;ll
soon be over, too.&quot; He detached the mirror
from its rest and placed it in his pocket. &quot;I
never knew a better one for shaving; it&#39;s so
handy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sergeant Snogger came into the bay again
frantic with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would like to know oo sent that bloody
message up,&quot; he thundered. &quot;Gawd, I&#39;ll find
out, and then someone will be damned unlucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped, then gave an inarticulate cry and
collapsed in a heap. Bubb&#39;s jaw dropped and
he stared at Snogger with dilated eyes. The
sergeant lay silent and motionless, death was instantaneous
for a shrapnel bullet had smashed
his spine.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy and Flanagan lifted the dead man in
their arms and placed him on the firestep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never seed anybody knocked out so sudden,&quot;
said Bubb in a nervous voice. &quot;One minute
speakin&#39; and then....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t think of it,&quot; said Flanagan. &quot;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
tanks are well on now. What a funny thing&mdash;tanks.
They are as old as the hills. Montaigne
speaks about them. He calls them coaches.
Listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fumbled in his haversack, brought out a
dilapidated volume&mdash;Florio&#39;s translation of Montaigne
and read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Were my memory sufficiently informed of
them I would not think my time lost, heere
to set down the infinite variety which histories
present to us of the use of coaches in the service
of warre: divers according to the nations
and different according to the ages: to my
seeming of great effect and necessity....
Even lately in our fathers&#39; time, the Hungarians
did very availefully bring them into
fashion and profitably set them a work against
the Turks; every one of them containing a
Targattier and a Muskettier, with a certain
number of harquebuses or calivers, ready
charged; and so ranged that they might make
good use of them: and all over covered with
a pavesado, after the manner of a Galliotte.
They made the front of their battaile with three
thousand such coaches: and after the Canon
had playd, caused them to discharge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
shoote of a volie of small shott upon their
enemies, before they should know or feel,
what the rest of the forces could doe: which
was no small advancement; or if not this, they
mainely drove those coaches amidde the thickest
of their enemies&#39; squadrons, with purpose
to breake, disroute and make waie through
them. Besides the benefit and helpe they
might make of them, in any suspicious or
dangerous place to flanke their troupe marching
from place to place: or in hast to encompasse,
to embarricade, to cover or fortifie any
lodgment or quarter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Captain Thorley appeared round the corner,
his hand bandaged. A splinter of shell had
caught him a few minutes before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Getting ready, boys?&quot; he asked. &quot;You&#39;ll
have no difficulty in crossing here.... Another
two minutes.... Snogger dead?...
What a pity!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish we did get across,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;I&#39;m
fed up wiv this waitin&#39;: I want to get at &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then a whistle was blown; another. The men
scrambled up the parapet and tumbled out on to
the levels.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
The bombardment seemed to increase; the
German trenches were hidden by smoke, flying
dirt and logs. Their dug-outs were going sky-high.
Over it all, two aeroplanes glided gracefully
through the air. The tanks were still
going forward. A platoon on the right had
started too soon and the men were half-way
across. Bowdy Benners and Bubb walked
abreast, chatting leisurely. Flanagan had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">The air was alive with bullets, men were falling
all round, groaning and screaming. In
front the tanks had both stopped, one in a shell-crater,
the other in a sap. The artillery lengthened
its range and the shells were falling behind
the first line and the High Wood. But
the enemy machine guns had not been silenced,
the High Wood was yet as venomous as a wasps&#39;
nest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forward!&quot; The men advanced at a steady
pace, their bayonets in air. One man had his
entrenching tool fastened over his stomach as a
bullet shield. Bowdy saw him get hit in the
head.... The machine gun fire was deadly;
dozens fell and lay writhing. A tall youngster
with a long neck came to a dead stop, dropped
his bayonet to the ground, put his hand inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
the waist of his trousers and groped around as
if trying to catch a flea. &quot;I&#39;ve copped a packet
this time,&quot; he said and lay down.</p>

<p class="indent">The flanks of the marching line converged on
the centre despite the orders of the officers to the
men. &quot;Keep your distance!&quot; &quot;Spread out a
bit there!&quot; etc. But the men felt inclined to
huddle together, like frightened children....
The machine guns seemed to intensify their fire,
the bullets struck the earth in a steady and incessant
stream. On the left a party of men
advanced steadily. A shell dropped in the middle
of them....</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Thorley, who was leading his platoon,
turned round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Under cover,&quot; he shouted. &quot;It&#39;s no good
going ahead yet. It&#39;s murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men disappeared into adjacent shell-holes,
others brought in the wounded. The machine-guns
swept the field with insistent vehemence.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy and Bubb joined themselves together
in a deep crater.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Couldn&#39;t &#39;ave a more swagger shell-&#39;ole than
this&#39;n,&quot; said Spudhole. &quot;We&#39;re in luck&#39;s way.
Flanagan got &#39;it,&quot; he continued. &quot;I saw &#39;im cop
it. Right froo the &#39;ead. &#39;E didn&#39;t say nuffin&#39;, just
fell and stiffened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
He placed his back against the sloping wall
of the swagger shell-hole and drawing his
cigarette from his mouth with a graceful swan-like
motion of the arm, he turned to Bowdy
Benners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, I don&#39;t feel &#39;arf a swell &#39;ere,&quot; he
said. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t mind stickin&#39; it in this &#39;ere
place for duration.... Eh, wot&#39;s that,
Bowdy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A German shell came out from the unknown
humming like a gigantic beetle. Nearer it came
and nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s going to fall wide,&quot; said Bowdy, although
he instinctively guessed that it would fall
very near.</p>

<p class="indent">It swept over the two men&#39;s heads with a
vicious swish and dived into the opposite wall of
the shell-hole. Bowdy went red in the face,
Bubb&#39;s jaw dropped, his eyes protruded as if
they were going to spring out of his head. The
shock paralysed the two boys for a second; they
were so unnerved that the feeling of fear was
momentarily denied them. They stared blankly
at the shell which had only entered about a foot
into the ground. The base of the projectile was
showing, it might explode at any moment. They
were in a position similar to that of a patient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
whose body a local an&aelig;sthetic is applied and who
sees the surgeon at work but does not feel the
knife. Bowdy was the first to recover his composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clear out of it, Spudhole!&quot; he yelled, and
both clambered across the rim of the crater into
the open.</p>

<p class="indent">They lay out there for a few minutes and as
the shell did not go off they went back again.
Outside the machine-gun bullets were ripping up
the ground. The two men lay down quietly
without speaking a word. Bubb put the stump
of his cigarette back in his mouth and relit it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There! See the aeroplanes?&quot; said Bowdy.
&quot;They&#39;re flying damned low over the enemy
trench. Hear their horns going? Signalling to
the artillery, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;S&#39;pose so,&quot; said Bubb, flattening out in the
bottom of the shell-crater and drawing his cigarette
from behind his ear. He put it in his mouth
and lit it. &quot;I knew it would be wanted,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes passed. The tanks were still
stuck and showed no sign of movement. The
English artillery opened on the High Wood
again. All guns within range had apparently
chosen it for their objective now. The oft-lacerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
tree-stumps were broken like glass,
they were dragged out by the roots and hurled
broadcast; the wood was disgorging its entrails.
The unfortunate wretches who held it were in a
ghastly situation. To remain in their dug-outs
was death. Their manner of dying was left to
their choice. They could come out into the hurricane
and be blown to bits, they could stay in
their lairs and be buried alive. They were confronted
by two evils, one as bad as the other.
The machine-guns were silent now; probably
they were all out of action.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy put up his head and looked across towards
the German lines.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God, they&#39;re getting it!&quot; he said. &quot;And
the tanks are still stuck.... There! There&#39;re
hundreds of the Germans coming across with
their hands up.... One batch is unlucky;
a shell has dropped in the middle of
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Far as I can see, we&#39;ll &#39;ave nuffink to do
when this strafin&#39; is over, bar go over an&#39; take
the trenches,&quot; said Bubb, who was looking at
the nerve-shaken Germans as they came rushing
towards the craters. &quot;I &#39;ope we get relieved to-night
after we&#39;ve finished.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Course we&#39;ll get relieved,&quot; said Bowdy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
&quot;We&#39;ve been in four days now.... Here,
what the devil&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A wild-eyed German, armed with a rifle and
bayonet, came to the rim of the crater and
lunged at Bubb. The Cockney, elusive as an
eel, slipped out of reach, seized his own rifle and
fired at the man. The German fell forward, dead,
the bullet had gone through his neck and pierced
the jugular vein.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Funny bloke, that feller,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he had gone mad,&quot; said Bowdy, changing
his position and getting clear of the prostrate
form which had fallen into the crater.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the artillery fire ceased ravaging
the German front line, the range was lengthened
and the guns devoted their attention to the
enemy&#39;s support trenches.</p>

<p class="indent">A whistle was blown....</p>

<p class="indent">The men went forward, Captain Thorley
leading. The bandage on his hand was very
dirty now.... The enemy trenches were
very quiet, not a rifle spoke. Parties of Germans
came out with their hands in air, muttering
&quot;Kamerad! Kamerad!&quot; They were taken
prisoners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a damned tame endin&#39;,&quot; said Bubb.
&quot;After all that strafing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s like a grand overture without a performance
following,&quot; said Captain Thorley who overheard
Bubb&#39;s remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Bubb replied. &quot;&#39;Ave yer a
match to spare, sir. I forgot mine. Left them
in the last dug-out, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Every move augmented the number of
prisoners, they rose from the ground and from
shell-holes and gave themselves up. Now and
again an apparently dead German was tickled
with the point of a bayonet and he came to life
with startling suddenness. Bubb discovered a
helmet, put it on and put up his hands in imitation
of the Germans who were surrendering....
Bowdy discovered a box of cigars somewhere and
lit up, then he handed the box round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a smoke, boys,&quot; said Captain Thorley.
&quot;Just to celebrate the taking of the High
Wood....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a shrapnel shell burst over
the captain&#39;s head and he fell to the ground
mortally wounded. A bullet had hit him on the
temple. A few men rushed in to his assistance,
Bubb leading. But nothing could be done. His
brains were oozing out.... Consciousness
was lost, death would come in a few moments.
A stretcher-bearer appeared, then another, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
they carried the captain away. He died before
reaching the dressing-station.</p>

<p class="indent">The London Irish now set about consolidating
their position and spent long hours of spade-work
on the job. Next night the men were relieved.</p>

</div>


<p class="indent">A soft rain was falling; a low wind swept
across the levels, and the leaves of a
near birch copse rustled in the breeze, faltering
timidly as they shook the rain from their
shining fringes. A soft, bluish haze surrounded
the tops of the birches, the trunks were engirt
with a pale mist which gave an eerie atmosphere
to the whole wood.</p>

<p class="indent">The London Irish had just left the trenches
and were following a sunken road on their way
back to billets and a month&#39;s rest. The men
were in a gay good humour, &quot;Charlotte the Harlot,&quot;
the Rabelaisian song was sung with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
gusto. The faces of sweet French maidens,
almost forgotten, were recalled again. The
men&#39;s fancies rushed hither and thither, painting
rosy pictures of snug farmhouses and good caf&eacute;s.
A month&#39;s rest away from the ructions of war;
how splendid!</p>

<p class="indent">Where the wood grew thinner a brushwood
screen had been improvised so as to hide the
road. In front lay an unlucky red brick village,
one which had suffered much from the guns of
war. Every third house had been hit by shell
fire and many of the homes were levelled to the
ground. A heavy wall of cloud, ragged of front
crawled across the sky; the sun was overcast, but
far up, shooting through the advancing layers of
black, a long, golden ray of sunshine streamed
out and lit up the firing line.</p>

<p class="indent">Save for the crunch of marching feet there was
quiet. The shower went by and the soft rustle
of the rain falling on the grass by the roadside
had ceased. All around the country lay in ruins,
the self-sown crops in the wide meadows
drooped abjectly to earth as if in mourning for
the reaper who visited the place no more. The
men passed a house which stood in the fields, a
little red-brick cottage with its chimney thrown
down, its doors latchless and its windows broken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
Once a home of thrifty, toiling people; now the
clear sun, which succeeded the shower, saw no
housewife at work, no children playing, no man
out in the fields storing up the harvest crops.
Nothing there now save the guns which lurked
privily and kept for the moment a decorous
silence. A big shell was following the men
along, bursting at intervals some five hundred
yards behind. The Germans were sweeping the
road, trusting that the projectile would drop on
any troops who might be marching along there.
The shell followed steadily, keeping its distance
and doing no harm. But the range might be
lengthened at any moment and then trouble
would ensue. The men marched rapidly, hardly
daring to breathe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gawd, I don&#39;t like that &#39;ere coal-box,&quot; said
Bubb, as he heard an explosion behind. &quot;That
blurry one was nearer, I fink.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Further off, I should say,&quot; Bowdy Benners
replied. &quot;Light a fag, Spudhole, it will do you
all the good in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He burst into song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Give me a lucifer to light my fag,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And laugh, boys, that&#39;s the style,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And smile, boys, smile.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
&quot;Come, boys, sing up,&quot; he called. &quot;Come on,
let go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The chorus was repeated and the men joined
in singing, roaring at the tops of their voices.
Bubb straightened his back, expanded his chest
and looked at his mate. Bowdy, with his cigarette
in his mouth, was bellowing out the chorus,
the cigarette moving up and down as if keeping
time with the measure.</p>

<p class="indent">Spudhole swept into a fresh song, a well-known
favourite. The men joined in the singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;There&#39;s a soldier out on picket</span><br />

<span class="i4">Over there.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The voices died away as a shell burst in the
road very close at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nearer that time,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;I wish we
were in the trenches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They sighted the village to find the shells
bursting all through the place and the buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
flying about the streets. The children were in
hiding, not a civilian was to be seen save a pale,
thin woman of forty who stood at the door of a
ruined estaminet. This had no doubt been her
home; probably she was still living in the cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">The men stared at the woman, saw her bowed
head, her ragged clothes, her queer, weedy form.
In her eyes was a look such as the men had
seldom seen. The poor creature reminded
Bowdy of a dog which he once had seen prowling
round a pond in which its young had been
drowned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot&#39;s she doin&#39; standin&#39; out in the street like
that?&quot; said Bubb. &quot;She&#39;ll stop a packet if she&#39;s
not careful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eyes right,&quot; came an order from an officer
in front, and the men turned their eyes towards
the woman at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Salutin&#39; &#39;er. I wonder wot for,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Er four children were killed yesterday by
a shell,&quot; said somebody in the ranks.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman raised her head and looked stolidly
at the soldiers. Her expression did not change;
perhaps feeling was dead within her.</p>

<p class="indent">At the other end of the village stood a ruined
convent from which the nuns had not yet departed.
They educated the village children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
The little ones went to school daily, their books
and respirators under their arms. The classroom
was in the cellar of the Convent. As the
men passed the Convent, they saw a nun, dressed
in blue homespun, white frontlet and black veil,
standing at the door throwing crumbs to the
doves which fluttered about her feet. In one
hand she held a rosary; no doubt she was saying
her prayers. There was France personified,
France great and fearless, a martyr unsubdued!
The sight was a tonic to the men. Unable to
resist the impulse, they gave vent to a rousing
cheer. A look of perplexity overspread the
woman&#39;s face, she gazed at the soldiers for a
moment, then throwing the remaining crumbs to
the birds she retreated hurriedly into the Convent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot a fine woman that one is,&quot; said Spudhole.
&quot;Gawd, there&#39;s somefin&#39; in &#39;em, you
know. An&#39; they don&#39;t do it for show, neither.
Well, we&#39;ll &#39;ave another song now, one respectable
like. Not one that we wouldn&#39;t want good
people to &#39;ear. &#39;Ow about &#39;Little Grey &#39;Ome in
the West&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the late afternoon the men arrived at the
village in which they were to billet. The battalion
marched down the main street dog-tired and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
glad that the march was at an end. The wineshops
were open and soldiers could be seen sitting
on the wine barrels, smoking and drinking.
At the corner of one side street, a cook was
washing his face at a pump and half-a-dozen
merry little children were flinging pebbles at him.
When a pebble hit him, he would bend down,
raise a mess-tin of water and fling it at the mischievous
rascals. A party of soldiers came out
from an alley, bearing between them three dixies
of hot, steaming tea. They were indulging in
idle banter and seemed very pleased with themselves&mdash;their
eyes glowed with happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">At the door of an estaminet stood the patronne
gossiping with a neighbour and laughing heartily
over something. Another party of children were
hopping over lines marked with chalk on the
pavement and chanting in unison a song of
which Bowdy could catch a few lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Bowdy&#39;s platoon came to a halt in the square,
the company cook who came there long in advance
of the battalion, was pouring fistfuls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
tea in a dixie which stood on a field kitchen. He
was red of face as a lobster, and a smile of satisfaction
lit up his genial countenance when he
saw the men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You look pleased with yourself,&quot; Bowdy
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So will you be pleased,&quot; said the man,
&quot;when you get your tea after a little. I&#39;ve made
it well, extra strong, and Spudhole has just received
a parcel from home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The post is up?&quot; Bubb asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a letter for you, as well as a parcel,&quot;
said the cook. &quot;And we are going back for a
rest to-morrow night, for a month or six weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are we really?&quot; Bowdy enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course we are,&quot; was the answer. &quot;And
we&#39;re going to get paid, too, this evening....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were going back for a rest, probably to
Cassel, and they knew such a delightful billet
there, the Y&mdash;&mdash; Farm....</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy breathed in the fresh air. Away behind
the firing line the sun was sinking and a
soft, luminous glow settled on the roofs of the
houses near.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We should have a bit of a spree to-night,&quot;
said the cook, raising the dixie of the waggon,
placing it on the ground, and stirring it with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
long ladle. &quot;At the caf&eacute; round the corner. A
champagne supper, a song, and an all-round entertainment.
Are you game for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey, of course we&#39;re game for it,&quot; said
Spudhole. &quot;Wot time will it start?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Arf past seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Righto,&quot; said Bubb and Bowdy in one voice.

<p class="indent">&quot;Gorblimey! This ain&#39;t arf a blurry
march,&quot; said Bubb, changing his rifle
from one shoulder to the other and
straightening himself up. &quot;I&#39;m feelin&#39; my feet,
my &#39;eels are rubbin&#39; against sandpaper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll soon be there now,&quot; said Bowdy
Benners. &quot;Another half hour. I remember the
place well. We haven&#39;t been here for&mdash;how
long? Almost a year and a half. Then there
were some good fellows with us. Old Fitz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
and Snogger and Flanagan and Captain Thorley
and Billy Hurd. Gone west, the poor
devils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I &#39;ad gone west,&quot; said Bubb, whose
head was sinking forward. &quot;This ain&#39;t worth
living for, this damned march. If I did go west
I wouldn&#39;t mind; there&#39;s a lot of good men waitin&#39;
to welcome us there. We&#39;ll never drink beer
with better blokes again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True for you, Bubb,&quot; said Bowdy. &quot;Brave
boys, the whole lot of them. Here, Spudhole,
I&#39;ll carry your rifle for you. You look done
up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb straightened himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, Bowdy, but I&#39;d rather carry me
&#39;ipe myself. Wot would these draft men think
if they see me gettin&#39; &#39;elped along? I&#39;m not a
rooky, Bowdy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Righto,&quot; said Bowdy, with a laugh. &quot;Your
independence will be the death of you one
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A halt was called at this juncture and the men
threw themselves down by the roadside. The
dusk of an October evening was settling on the
poplar-lined roadway. The spinneys on either
side were wrapped in shadow and a cold wind
swept across the fields. In a farm somewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
near a dog barked and a cart rumbled along a
lane. The chiming of a church bell could be heard
calling the faithful to prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">Bowdy took off his pack, lit a cigarette, and
sat on a milestone which bore the inscription:
&quot;A Cassel 5 kilo.&quot; The milestone, which indicated
the wrong direction, had been reversed
by the peasantry when war broke out in hopes of
turning the German Army in a wrong direction.
Bubb lay flat on his back, his feet cocked up,
his tunic open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wunner if Fifi is kickin&#39; about now,&quot; he
said. &quot;She wasn&#39;t &#39;arf a bird. Ole Snogger
was fair gone on &#39;er, so was pore Fitz. Bet yer,
she&#39;ll be lookin&#39; for a new Tommy this time.
Why don&#39;t ye go in an&#39; say things to &#39;er, Bowdy?
Ye&#39;re a devil for fightin&#39;, a devil for drinkin&#39;,
and ye&#39;re no damned good at all when a wench
is about. If I &#39;adn&#39;t me own bird back off Walworth
Road wiv &#39;er barrer, I&#39;d lead Fifi a
dance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wot about the girl at Gorre,&quot; said Bowdy
Benners. &quot;You forgot all about Walworth
Road when you went to see her on a stretcher
with a ground-sheet for a uniform.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb never wanted to be reminded of this incident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
but at the present time he was too tired to
pay any heed to Bowdy&#39;s remarks.</p>

<p class="indent">At seven o&#39;clock the platoon arrived at Y&mdash;&mdash;
Farm and the men were conducted to the old
barn in which a few of them had billeted before.
Bowdy and Bubb sat down on the straw and took
off their puttees, lit their cigarettes and fumbled
in their pockets for money. Fifi, of course,
would give them soup and coffee free; but they
felt it becoming to them to offer money, even
though it was not accepted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along,&quot; said Bowdy, lighting a fresh
cigarette. &quot;Fifi will be waiting for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went down the crazy stairs and across
the farmyard towards the house. Everything
about the place was the same as of old, the midden,
the sloughy pools, the up-ended waggons,
the grunting of the pigs in the stye, the restless
movement of cattle in the byre and the noisy
growling of the dog. Bubb recalled the night
of his return from the caf&eacute; of Jean Lacroix.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same blurry dawg,&quot; he said to Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look!&quot; whispered Bubb, as the two got near
the door. &quot;There&#39;s Fifi. Gawd! She &#39;asn&#39;t
&#39;arf changed.... Stout.... She must be
married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
They entered. Fifi rushed forward to meet
them, and clasping Bubb with both arms she
kissed him on the lips. Then she kissed Bowdy,
who blushed as red as a beetroot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m damned,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Ye&#39;re not
&#39;arf a giddy one, Fifi.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She must have been working hard during the
day, for her hair was all untidy, her linen
soiled and stained, her skirts in the same condition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back from the trenches?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back again,&quot; said Bubb who could follow
the remark, though spoken in French.
&quot;Trenches no bong,&quot; he said. &quot;Ploosier mon
camerads mort, more bliss&eacute;e. Guerre never
fini.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sergen, is zee dead?&quot; asked Fifi, speaking
in English. &quot;The bon sergen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E&#39;s dead,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Also Flanagan; also
Captain Thorley....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mon p&egrave;re mort,&quot; said the girl, and her eyes
filled with tears. &quot;Mort &agrave; Verdun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. The two soldiers
sat down near the stove. Fifi put a basin of
soup over the fire. Madame Babette came in
from the byre, her heavy shoes covered with
cow-dung, and placed a pail of milk on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
dresser. She shook hands with Bubb and
Bowdy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back from the trenches?&quot; she enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back for a month&#39;s rest,&quot; Bowdy replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I s&#39;pose you&#39;re married now, Fifi?&quot; Bubb
remarked, fixing his eyes on the girl. She did
indeed look like a married woman; the old
sprightly manner was gone; her face was pale
and quiet now, and a tinge of sadness had crept
into her voice. The old Fifi, the full-throated
coquette of eighteen months ago, had given place
to a prudent housewife whose interests did not
extend beyond the marches of the farm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am married,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good husband?&quot; asked Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tr&egrave;s bon,&quot; said Fifi. &quot;He will be in from
his work directly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;ve forgotten Fitzgerald, the Irishman,&quot;
said Bubb. &quot;&#39;E was a good man. &#39;E&#39;s dead
now; killed by an oboo grand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fifi chuckled. Bubb looked at Bowdy and
could not resist giving expression to the thoughts
which came into his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just like these &#39;ere French birds,&quot; he
muttered. &quot;They&#39;ll &#39;ave their bit of fun wiv
a bloke an&#39; then when &#39;e goes away it&#39;s &#39;Goodbye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
and be damned t&#39;yer, and we don&#39;t care wot
&#39;appens t&#39;yer.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fifi, who seemed to have made great progress
in her knowledge of English, laughly loudly at
Bubb&#39;s remarks. Then she raised a warning
finger. Somebody had come to the door and
this somebody was rubbing heavy boots on the
cobbles in an endeavour to get the dirt from the
soles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My husband,&quot; said Fifi.</p>

<p class="indent">He came in, stood for a moment, and gazed
awkwardly at the two soldiers. Bubb stared
open-mouthed at the man, Bowdy contracted his
eyebrows and rubbed one eye with a miry finger,
then the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bon soir, m&#39;soo,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Ye&#39;re damned
like a mate as we &#39;ad, old Fitz.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not surprised at that, Spudhole,&quot; said
the man, coming forward and gripping both the
men&#39;s hands and shaking them as if they were
pump handles. &quot;Not a bit surprised, for I am
ole Fitz.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But ye&#39;re dead,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Almost had been ... but luck was with
me,&quot; said Fitzgerald, still pump-handling.
&quot;And you. I heard you two were killed,
Bowdy and Bubb ... I never expected....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
It&#39;s damned strange what does happen....
We&#39;ve no end of things to talk about.... Fifi,
get a meal ready, the best bottle of wine ...
we have much to say.... It&#39;s all gushing
out.... God! it&#39;s good to see you two here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fitzgerald sat down, crossed his legs, felt in
his pockets and brought out a packet of English
cigarettes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a fag, Bubb&mdash;Bowdy,&quot; he said, laughing
boyishly. &quot;I&#39;ve left England, but I can&#39;t
resist these.... Oh! damn it!... Isn&#39;t it
good to see you two here.... Old Snogger....
I know, I saw it in the press. Thorley,
too, and Flanagan.... We&#39;ll go into the
corner and have a talk.... We won&#39;t be disturbed
and rations will be ready in no time. I&#39;m
excited, Bowdy. Bubb, I&#39;m off my head. I&#39;m
so glad, so damned glad that I could give you
a punch right on the tip of your nose.... But
you&#39;ll not understand the feelings which give
rise to a manifestation of gladness such as that,
Spudhole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blimey! Ye&#39;re just the same ole Fitz, same
as ever,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where can I begin and tell everything?&quot;
said Fitzgerald, breaking a
piece of bread and bringing it up
to within an inch of his mouth. &quot;I suppose that
night when I was buried in the dug-out will do to
start with. &#39;Twas the devil&#39;s own night. I got
lost first of all, and me going up with a message
to Captain Thorley. &#39;Twas very important, a
mine going up in the morning. So the young
German prisoner whom we had taken said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Therefore, our men holding the front line had to
retire for safety to the support trenches. So up
I goes from Headquarters, running like hell (I&#39;m
getting ungrammatically excited, Spudhole) and
gets lost. Took the wrong turning, flops into a
trench that was full of muck. I stuck there for
goodness knows how long, holding on to the
piece of paper on which the message was
scrawled. I thought I was a permanent fixture,
stuck in that trench for duration. But somehow I
did get free and eventually found myself in our
front line. How I got there I don&#39;t know. I mind
seeing you, Spudhole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was some dirt coming along our way
at that time,&quot; said Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twas that shell that did it,&quot; said Fitzgerald,
gazing absently at his piece of bread, which he
still held between finger and thumb. &quot;Someone
said &#39;Whoo! There she comes!&#39; and there
was a rush for the dug-out. I got mixed up in
the scramble and was carried in with the rest.
But I still clung on to my message. Then the
shell came down on the dug-out and I was out of
the doings, just like a gutted sprat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As far as I can judge I was underground that
night, the next day, the night after, and got pulled
out the day following at twelve o&#39;clock. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
men of the regiment that relieved us saw a bayonet
that stuck up through the roof of the fallen
dug-out move as if someone was shaking it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw that &#39;ere bay&#39;net,&quot; said Bubb. &quot;Stickin&#39;
up over the roof.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, these fellows, when they saw the bayonet
wobbling, guessed that someone was alive
under the ground, and they began to dig like hell,&quot;
said Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eventually they reached me, still alive, with
a wound on the back of my head, and they pulled
me out. The air had got in somehow, I suppose....
Well, I came to my senses in hospital in
Versailles, and I got up, so I was told, and rushed
along the ward like hell, with a nurse or two
clinging to my shirt tail. &#39;Where are you running?&#39;
they asked me. &#39;I&#39;m going on a message
to Captain Thorley,&#39; I told them. &#39;There&#39;s a
mine going up at dawn.&#39; &#39;Oh, that&#39;s all right,&#39;
said the nurses. &#39;Captain Thorley has got the
message and everything&#39;s all right.&#39; And they
wheedled me and coaxed me until I went back to
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I was told; but I didn&#39;t remember anything
about it. Even now my mind gets mazed
at times when I&#39;m excited, and queer ideas come
into my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
&quot;You haven&#39;t eaten one bite yet,&quot; said Bowdy
Benners. &quot;That bit of bread hasn&#39;t gone into
your mouth, and we&#39;ve been sitting here for the
last ten minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m not hungry,&quot; said Fitzgerald. &quot;I&#39;m
feeding on the pleasure of seeing you two here.
Fifi, the wine!&quot; he called to his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman brought a large bottle, placed it on
the table, and patted her husband on the head
with an affectionate hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s a divine creature,&quot; said Fitzgerald,
when Fifi went. &quot;How did it happen that the
gods were so good to me? I don&#39;t know....
But to get on with my story,&quot; he continued.
&quot;After a while I found myself in England. I
don&#39;t even remember crossing the Channel. I
was in a muddle all the while. Sometimes I would
think I was in the trenches and I would wake up
from my sleep, jump out on the floor and stand
against the wall, thinking that I was on the firestep
on guard. I must have been a troublesome
patient.... And then one night when I was in
a big bed in a big house in England I thought
that somebody put a cold hand over my forehead.
I shouted out &#39;Who&#39;s there?&#39; I opened my eyes,
looked up and saw a man with a black beard
standing at my bed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
&quot;&#39;Who are you ?&#39; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Your Sergeant-major,&#39; said the man. &#39;I
want you to present arms,&#39; he said. &#39;At the
word &quot;one&quot; you give the rifle a sharp cant up
to the right side, gripping it at the small of the
butt with the right hand and at the outer band
with the left....&#39; I stared at the fellow
and this seemed to annoy him. &#39;Dumb contempt!&#39;
he yelled. &#39;You&#39;ll be for it!&#39; and
he raised his fist and made one smash at my face.
I dodged the blow and then a man in a warder&#39;s
uniform rushed in and pulled the sergeant-major
away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God, Bowdy, where was I? Guess.
I was in a lunatic asylum.... &#39;Twas enough
to turn my brain. And it&#39;s a difficult job to
prove that you&#39;re sane when you&#39;re in a madhouse.
They won&#39;t believe you, for some
damned reason or another. I used to go up to
the warder and say: &#39;Look here, matey, I&#39;m as
right as rain,&#39; and he would nod his head and
say: &#39;Oh, yes, of course you are.&#39; But &#39;twas
easy enough to see that he didn&#39;t believe you.
God! I often felt like strangling the man....
It wouldn&#39;t do me any good, I knew, to kick
up a ruction; so I kept very quiet and well-behaved.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
&quot;At the end of six weeks I was discharged
and sent to a convalescent camp; not as good as
the one that Flanagan had been in when he got
wounded. Impossible to swing the lead there. I
got sick of it in no time, so I applied for a transfer
to the B.E.F., somewhere in France.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Do you really want to go out there again?&#39;
my mates asked me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course I do,&#39; I told them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Then you must be mad,&#39; they said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I had no luck with my application. &#39;Out
to the trenches again,&#39; said the M.O. Tut, tut,
man! I&#39;ll bring you before a Board and see
what it says.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Board said &#39;Discharge&#39; and I was discharged
with a pension. So there I was out on
my own, a wash-out. Patrick Fitzgerald, pensioner,
non bon, one that had done his bit, who
had been through the thick of it, in the doings,
a brave boy, lion-hearted, and so on. My friends
took me into their arms and made no end of a
fuss of me. England had reason to be proud of
her sons, they said, and took me about to swell
dinners.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like ole Flan when &#39;e was at &#39;ome,&quot; said
Bubb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hobnobbed with big bugs,&quot; Fitzgerald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
continued, &quot;grand old men who were in the
know and who knew everything, having inside
information; well-dressed women who preached
economy to the masses, who denied themselves
luxuries which they were healthier without, who
rode on common buses and advertised the fact,
and who travelled by tube as an example to
those who always travel by tube. Nobody paid
much heed to them as far as I could see. The
people with whom I stopped denied themselves
the services of a butler and took in his place an
extra female servant. They were very rich, and
self-denial was their greatest craze. In furthering
their country&#39;s cause they displayed as much
ingenuity as a cautious billiard player who just
misses the balls. I grew tired of it all, wearied
to death,&quot; said Fitzgerald, placing his bread on
the table and pulling the wine bottle towards him.
He pulled out the cork, filled his mates&#39; glasses,
but took no notice of his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t do for me to take any now,&quot; he
said, in an apologetic voice. &quot;It goes to here.&quot;
He tapped his head with his fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was once,&quot; said Bubb....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but that&#39;s a thing of the past,&quot; said
Fitzgerald. &quot;I did go into a pub when I was
in London. I wanted to have a yarn with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
Old Sweats who frequented the taproom. I
made them merry and they carried me home.
&#39;Twasn&#39;t honey after that. Old Fitz, the boy
who had been through the thick of it and who
had done his bit, was rather a burden to his
friends. He had wild ways; his manners were
unbecoming, he had said dreadful things when
under the influence of alcohol. My friends took
me aside, lectured me and suggested that if I
was placed in a little cottage somewhere out of
sight, given a few pounds in addition to my pension,
I would be much happier....</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I left them; the brave boy who had done his
bit and who went through the thick of it vamoosed.
I didn&#39;t even wait for the additional
few pounds.... Then an uncle of mine died
and left me six hundred pounds. I collared this,
wrote to Fifi, whom I had not forgotten....
She remembered me.... Her father was
killed at Verdun. What could I do but come
over and see her? &#39;Twas an easy matter then.
I had some money, I loved her; so we got married.
She&#39;s a grand woman, Bowdy. I didn&#39;t
understand her when we were billeted here; I
don&#39;t even understand her yet.... Oh, how
she misses her father, but she bears it as a
Frenchwoman can. I tried to console her at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
first, but I say nothing about her loss now. First
she used to say, when we spoke about her father&#39;s
death: &#39;C&#39;est la guerre,&#39; but now it&#39;s different.
It&#39;s now: &#39;He died for France and it&#39;s an honour
to die for one&#39;s country.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bubb filled his glass, Bowdy did the same. The

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
